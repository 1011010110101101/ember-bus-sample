Flixbus Global,"First time using flix buses, never again!!",1,,2025-04-07T08:32:31.000Z,"First time using flix buses, will never use again. |  | Bus driver was very rude and unapproachable. Had a patronising response to every question any passenger had to ask him. Would travel up and down the bus at every stop and shout and threaten people. Passengers weren't nice either. |  | Bus took an extra hour to arrive at final stop. On top of that the whole bus smelled like garlic the whole time. Never travelling with flix again, never had a single bad experience with megabus, the cheap tickets arent worth it to be treated with disrespect by rude and disrespectful flix drivers. |  | Furthermore, I had messaged my friend and she told me that same day, same bus station, she and a group of girls had to get a supervisor down because a flix bus driver was yelling at them for no reason. Have in mind these two complaints are coming from two girls aged 20 and 21. So what these men gain from randomly yelling at us, who knows. Should not have their jobs if they cant answer simple questions politely!!"
Flixbus Global,Very very bad service and bus drivers…,1,,2025-04-06T16:23:14.000Z,"Very very bad service and bus drivers !!! | i take flexibus from Paris charles de gaule to Antwerp and always a very bad drivers are here irespectful to clients talk screaming !!! and no one speaks french or english which is hard to communicate with !!! and also in they don’t controll the bus from incivilzed people who talks loud, making calls inside the bus etc. it’s really a third world bus , even worser !"
Flixbus Global,Not worth your energy and money,1,,2025-04-06T10:20:58.000Z,"Not worth your energy, time and money. While waiting no alert was made to make passengers aware of the boarding happening, bus departed at 10:30 after realising the boarding was near completed we made our way at around 10:27 and were denied access to enter by the 2 disrespectful employees who deserve to lose their jobs."

I put my bag on then he shoved it with force so that it fell off the pile of bags.
Flixbus Global,THEY LIED AND STOLE MONEY AND TIME,1,,2025-04-05T10:06:38.000Z,"Me and my friend were left stranded in Venice, causing a huge loss of money and time. Our ticket said that the bus leaves from stop C4 but in reality it left from several stops away from the location written in the ticket. |  | Their agent then lied that the bus left from C4, even though we had picture evidence of being at C4 15 minutes before departure. She offers 15 euros as a refund which we never got. |  | We then had to book a new bus to another city which we can prove left from another location than stated in the ticket, but luckily we made it. We also had to pay a hotel for the night and two more tickets for an early morning bus. None of these were offered to be refunded. Instead they lied that their radar shows the busses left from C4 and that our videos are useless. |  | They opened several incidents, but for months we didn't hear from them. Every time we tried to talk through their chat, they offered 0.98 cents, and when we asked about the 15 euros and incident numbers from the cases or to talk to someone else, they just closed the chat. |  | We are sending the screen shots, screen recordings as well as videos and pictures of our failed departures to the authorities, as flixbus is evidently unwilling to solve the issues."

Flixbus Global,Minus 5 stars…On April 2,1,,2025-04-04T03:56:19.000Z,"—5 stars…On April 2, 2025 at 6:27 PM, I was followed by a Flixbus bus (plate # LA-34409 N. Carolina)…I was in a line of traffic going westbound down Penn View Mtn. on Rt. 22 towards Blairsville, PA. and the bus driver was no more than 20’ (literally) off my bumper at 70 MPH. I intentionally slowed up forcing him to pass me then followed and videoed him driving 82 MPH on the 55 MPH posted highway. The driver carried his high rate of speed coming into a traffic light and passed thru it at 70 MPH. TOTALLY IRRESPONSIBLE AND A DANGER TO OTHER DRIVERS NOT TO MENTION HIS PASSENGERS!!! Flixbus’ website provides no means of contacting them—Surprise! Surprise! Getting a sense that Flixbus is nothing more than a 2-bit company full of empty promises."

Flixbus Global,Absolutely nonsense!,1,,2025-04-02T23:16:49.000Z,"Absolutely nonsense! |  | Do not buy any tickets from this company. |  | I purchased a ticket and needed to change it for one day later. I used the “manage booking” feature and followed every step correctly. The system charged my card, but I never received a confirmation. The Flix bus system indicated that my bank canceled the purchase, which is not true; they charged me. I then tried using another card and encountered the same issue. |  | I called customer service, and by a miracle, someone picked up on my fourth attempt. Unfortunately, they were not helpful and merely suggested I try using Chrome. I did that, but it didn’t solve the issue. I decided to cancel my booking and attempt to book a new route. I managed to cancel, but of course, I received no money back—only a voucher for future use. |  | I tried calling again…never picked up anymore. |  | When I tried to buy a new ticket, I was charged again, but once more, I did not receive any ticket. They still owe me money. I will never buy a ticket from them again, and instead of a voucher, I want my money back. |  | After 30 mins I have received some money back yet, they still own me."
Flixbus Global,One company. Two services. Zero accountability,1,,2025-04-02T05:18:59.000Z,"I booked a FlixBus from Munich to Stuttgart Airport on March 22, 2025. | To be safe, I added over 2 hours of buffer time for my FlixTrain connection. | The bus showed up more than 2 hours late, took a bizarre detour through backroads and small towns (instead of the obvious highway), and I missed my train. |  | That train was also operated by Flix. |  | And here comes the absurd part: FlixTrain charged me a cancellation fee – even though it was FlixBus that caused me to miss it. |  | I contacted customer service twice. I provided receipts, explained everything, asked fair questions. | The replies? |  | “We consider your journey to have been completed as contracted.” | “We apologize for the inconvenience.” |  | No explanation for the delay. | No acknowledgment of the detour. | No refund. | Just copy-paste sentences with zero relevance to my actual complaint. |  | At some point, I genuinely started to wonder whether FlixBus has hired a team of trained chimpanzees with access to Outlook and a list of pre-written replies. | No offense intended – but if that’s the case, someone should probably inform PETA. |  | The whole thing feels like internal pickpocketing: | FlixBus delays you → you miss FlixTrain → FlixTrain charges you. | One company, two failures, one customer left paying for both. |  | I’m not angry because of the money. It wasn’t that much. | I’m angry because of the way they treat their customers – like numbers to be filtered out, not people to be helped. | Never again."
Flixbus Global,Absolutely revolting scumbags,1,,2025-03-30T13:53:50.000Z,"Absolutely revolting scumbags. Avoid at all costs. |  | They cancelled three consecutive buses with no prior information. Staff hid and smoked and laughed in customers faces. Victoria staff were very helpful but said they ""always have problems"" with Flixbus staff. Had to get a train after waiting for three hours and it's proving incredibly hard to get a refund."
Flixbus Global,Worst bus ever…,1,,2025-03-29T22:26:08.000Z,Worst bus ever…. Please don’t let the cheap fare trick you. Use National Express or spend a few more quid and purchase a train ticket. After having the customers waiting in the freezing cold due to a 1hr delay. The drivers stopped at the services for 40 minutes. another | 2 hours added to the journey time.
Flixbus Global,The Only Thing Faster Than the Bus is Customer Service Hanging Up on You,1,,2025-03-29T20:04:23.000Z,"I booked a bus at a specific time for a reason. Imagine my surprise when, the day before my trip, I received a message from the bus operator informing me that my bus was now leaving 40 minutes earlier—a tricky little detail that made it impossible for me to actually catch it, since it was an airport transfer and I can’t teleport through baggage claim. |  | I tried to contact the operator. No response. So, I contacted FlixBus, who were still selling tickets for the original time, yet somehow couldn't confirm when (or if?) the bus was actually running. That’s some next-level Schrödinger’s bus situation right there. |  | Then the agent, after being thoroughly unhelpful, hung up on me whilst I was still asking for help. Because she had ""other customers waiting."" | I assume this is just an efficient way to clear the queue by cutting off as many people as possible before the end of her shift. Respect the hustle, but not exactly great customer service. |  | Would love to hear how you plan to address this (preferably without hanging up on me again)."
Flixbus Global,Flixbus is the worst bus company,1,,2025-03-28T23:05:46.000Z,"I was going from Ploče to Zagreb the bus broke down a little before Split and we waited for 5 HOURS for to them to send a new bus from Dubrovnik, I missed 2 important doctor appointments and they didn't want to refund anything this was a waste of a lot of my time and money."

Flixbus Global,Ultimate disaster,1,,2025-03-27T13:44:29.000Z,"This happened in Dundee. They’ve sent an email mentioning the pick up stop has been changed - even on the website there’s a note about the place change. But the bus arrived at the usual pick up place and took off, while we were waiting at the stop mentioned in the email. | There’s no coordination or communication within the company. My friend missed her interview due to poor communication and irresponsible behavior of this company. | Avoid flix to avoid disappointments"
Flixbus Global,Almost left behind,1,,2025-03-24T01:15:52.000Z,"This is related to my trip from Prague to Frankfurt using FlixBus. The driver needs to communicate more with the passengers and in English as well. He stopped a number of times to drop passengers. In one of the occasions when the driver stopped in Nuremberg bus station, I noticed some people buying juice in the grocery store at the station and I made an attempt to go there to buy water as I was thirsty. As I was about to pay for the water the driver started driving his way and leaving me behind. That was a big fright to me. I ran after the bus and I could see that the driver saw me and he continued on his way without stopping until he stopped at the traffic light as it was red. With the help of the grocery store attendant the driver now open the door. I told him that I was on the bus and he was leaving me. He then asked me if I was sure I was on the bus which I confirmed I was. He gave out to me saying that he didn’t say to anybody we could leave the bus. The problem is that he never said we could leave in any station at all, at least not in plain English and this is a long trip and is reasonable that people might want to buy some snack on the way. What pissed me off is that soon he stopped in another location further and handled the bus to another driver. Again no communication was made and we waited there at that place between 20 to 30 minutes. I might be wrong but my understanding of the situation is that the first driver was rushing to finish his shift and to do so he wouldn’t mind leaving passengers behind. If he had left me I would have been screwed as my suitcase, my backpack with my passport and documents were all in the bus. This was a big “No” for me. I wouldn’t recommend FlixBus if this attitude reflects anyhow the values of the company."
Flixbus Global,Booked a flix bus from London to…,4,,2025-03-25T13:07:54.000Z,FlixBus sent a reply to apologize for the mixup that happened 21/03/2025 concerning my experience with their bus on Heathrow airport. I have also received my refund.
Flixbus Global,Never again !,1,,2025-03-21T10:28:55.000Z,"This was my first and last time using this service. I was given the wrong information about the bus stop, and despite calling customer service several times, no one could tell me where I needed to go. It was an absolute joke. I ended up asking other people and eventually found the bus stop myself. To make matters worse, the bus arrived late, and it was dirty and uncomfortable. My advice: stick with National Express—this service is absolutely terrible."
Flixbus Global,This company shouldn't be in business.,1,,2025-03-21T09:02:50.000Z,"This company shouldn't be in business. | They're clearly not capable of taking responsibility for their own mistakes. | A couple minutes before leaving home I was notified of a 45 minutes delay on my trip, which was originally scheduled to depart at 4.45 am. | The email said to be at the stop 15 minutes before the forecasted time, which was then 5.30am. | I arrived at the bus stop at 5 am, and about five minutes after that, the forecasted time changed from 5.30 am to 4.58 am, meaning the bus had departed two minutes before I arrived. | Needless to say I would have never missed the bus had I not received their email stating a delay that was in fact 10 minutes and not 45. | Tried to explain this to their customer support, and the guy clearly had already decided that I didn't deserve a refund before even understanding the whole story. | He denied that any email was sent to me even after I showed it to him, he kept on blaming me for not being there fifteen minutes before the scheduled time, when the email stated to be there before the forecasted time, not the original scheduled one. | So not only I'm not able to attend an extremely important medical check that will take months to be rescheduled, I'm also not gonna be refunded for the tickets I can't use due to their massive mistake. | Avoid this company like the plague. Highly unprofessional."
Flixbus Global,Horrible customer service on the phone,1,,2025-03-20T13:23:30.000Z,"Horrible customer service on the phone. Rude, spoke poor english, did not listen, interrupted me, refused to help."
Flixbus Global,Inexpensive but dirty and potentially unsafe,2,,2025-03-20T05:24:31.000Z,"Certainly inexpensive but standards of cleanliness and safety inadequate. I travelled London to Krakow. The coach to Paris had a cracked windscreen and was grubby. The Paris bus station used by Flix is smelly and a bit menacing late at night. One of the drivers on the coach to Krakow repeatedly looked at his phone while driving and the bus had a toilet without soap or water in the handbasin which, on a 22 hour journey, is inexcusable."

Flixbus Global,Terrible service and customer service.,1,,2025-03-19T10:38:23.000Z,Terrible service and customer service.
Flixbus Global,This is the absolute WORST company…,1,,2025-03-18T22:32:47.000Z,"This is the absolute WORST company ever. All around in terms of customer service and literally corporate THEFT! |  | It was my first time booking with flixbus a trip from Oshawa to Belleville. | I paid EXTRA for a second luggage. | I arrived at the bus stop as per the flixbus instructed, and I arrived at that stop 15 minutes early as suggested. | I waited at the the intersection and location as described in the flixbus directions. | The bus never came! Instead I saw the bus across the street stopped at a different location than was instructed in the flixbus directions. At the time of departure the bus turned from where it was and proceeded to the highway. I was standing on the opposite side with two luggage bags watching it leave! | I asked flixbus for a refund proving that their instructions were incorrect. They agreed with me that their directions were inaccurate (where I was told to wait, was not where the bus stop was located). | Even after they resent the same incorrect instructions and confirmed it to be true. They refused to refund my money! Not even the extra baggage fee! |  | They said that because most of the other passengers got on the bus successfully, (who knows where they got on), that I couldn't get a refund because the bus was on time and other people got on it. How is this justified I don't know! Either way they cost me $200 Uber ride to Belleville. They are a heartless and cruel company do not ever travel with them! It's best take the train. Similar prices and a nicer more scenic ride (as I later found out)."
Flixbus Global,Very disappointed with this service,1,,2025-03-17T15:59:44.000Z,"Very disappointed with this service. I booked two tickets for an trip 4 months ahead, and within 2 hours had realised I had made an error with the booking and was only entitled to a voucher valid for 12 months which more than likely will not get used. I contacted customer service and explained that it was literally 2 hours since booking and again requested a refund as I hate to waste money. I appreciate the cancellation policy but there should definitely be a period for refund especially within 12 to 24h and with a booking over 90 days in advance. The lack of flexibility and terrible policy - I will never use this service again €80 down the drain. Disappointed."
Flixbus Global,"Upselling and Polish ""return policy""",1,,2025-03-16T17:04:18.000Z,"Due to work, I use Flixbus services alternating with PKP (Polish railways) about once a week. The comfort of the ride may be greater on Flixbus, but lately I've noticed that Flixbus is busily looking for ways to make more money without raising the standards and while keeping a semblance of price competitiveness with PKP or other cheaper carriers. |  | When searching for rides, I'm informed of a ticket price that appears to be competitive, but that's just the beginning of the story. In addition to ""service fees"" (=the ability to buy a ticket on the website??), I can also choose to pay a surcharge to reserve a specific seat, with the ""best"" seats (at the front of the bus) - costing as much as an additional 9.99zł. And recently Flixbus has apparently also changed its refund policy. Today I read on the website that at the moment to get a full refund (of the ticket price itself - for example, the so-called ""booking fee"" for a particular seat is never refundable at all) you need to cancel your trip 30 DAYS IN ADVANCE. On the other hand, if you cancel later than 2 days before the trip, you can expect a 20% refund - the rest is absorbed by the ""cancellation fee"". Based on my recent experience with this company (as I mentioned, I travel frequently), I conclude that this is a fairly new provision. |  | Does anyone even book bus trips a month in advance - let alone cancel them on such a date? I sincerely doubt it. After today's experience, it also looks to me that even changing the departure date incurs an additional charge (when I do not return the ticket, but only exchange it). Also, it seems that as a customer I don't particularly have a choice. If I want to be able to possibly get a full refund for the ticket (excluding the booking fee and other services), I would have to book it way in advance and count on my plans changing no later than 30 days before departure. If I buy later, in addition to all the additional costs at the time of purchase, I also have to reckon with the fact that in the event of a change of plans most of the amount will be lost, even if I return the ticket 2 days before departure, when the carrier still has time to sell the seat to someone else, ultimately earning on one seat about 180% of its price. If not more, because prices often rise jist before departure. |  | Bottom line: I will not set foot in Flixbus anymore. At this point, I prefer PKP, which at least lists the full price of the ticket on the website right away, allows me to exchange it for free up to 15min before the trip, and doesn't charge me for booking a place, using their website, etc. And in addition, it also often has WiFi, which Flixbus brags about so much, but theirs, like PKP's, sometimes does not work."
Flixbus Global,Avoid at any cost,1,,2025-03-18T13:21:45.000Z,"Avoid at any cost. Use NEO or other lines in the EU. They basically allocate seats for some people and give free seats for others, which means if you are going with overbook bus you just might end up standing… or changing seats non stop. I took the 1270 route. The driver didn’t give me any seat cuz he couldn’t even understand basic English which I feel you should if you’re employed for international bus company…. The support line also just said I should have paid extra to have a seat and that now on driver can help me, who just showed in gestures he doesn’t understand anything…oh and ppl were drinking vodka and it was smelly and ofc no one cared. AVOID. | Reply: YES, a BAD experience in fact discourages me to travel with you again, your response just shows how inadequate you are as a company. Ppl just use LUX bus."
Flixbus Global,Horrible experience,1,,2025-03-14T18:55:32.000Z,"Horrible experience, supposed to have a trip from Germany to London Victoria, when I arrived in den Haag I got told via message that the bus is cancelled. It was 11oclock at night, had to go on another bus to Paris which was another 19 hours!!! I was tired and hungry and then I had to book another train ticket from London to my home city I missed it aswell because at the end when I arrived in Paris to Calais the ferry’s was striking …. Another hours of waiting… called flixbus to get a refund and the customer service said he will give me a refund but never received it. Very bad liars and unhelpful. There was another old lady at den haag but there was only two tickets for the bus to Paris left, which she got unlucky cuz it got already taken she called customer service and they didn’t help her. She had to sleep at the train station!!! She didn’t had internet service so she couldn’t get a hotel or find anything, I hope she got home safe somehow…."
Flixbus Global,Wrong location of the Bus Stop,1,,2025-03-14T00:16:41.000Z,"I bought a ticket from Trieste to Venezia. The bus was supposed to leave from the place 2 inside the BUS station, but it left from the outside of the station. For that reason I lost my bus and had to buy a train ticket. Flixbus denied to pay a refund for this. Actually their position was of totally ""we don't care""."
Flixbus Global,FlixBus Ignored Domestic Abuse and Assault Onboard – Passenger Safety Completely Neglected,1,,2025-03-10T15:36:59.000Z,"I am writing this review to warn others about the complete failure of FlixBus to ensure passenger safety and the appalling customer service I experienced in the aftermath of a serious assault during one of their journeys. |  | On 7th March 2025, I travelled on FlixBus from Paris Bercy Seine (21:00) to London Victoria Coach Station (scheduled arrival 05:25 UK time). What should have been a routine journey turned into one of the most terrifying experiences of my life. |  | What happened: | Shortly after we departed Paris, a male passenger seated at the back of the coach (seat B on the back row) began screaming at his partner, subjecting her to hours of verbal abuse, including extremely aggressive and misogynistic language. |  | I personally witnessed him shove her. | Another passenger later told me they saw him put his hands around her neck and strangle her. | When I spoke up and told him to stop, he turned his aggression towards me, shouting things like: | “You’re a tramp, you’re a slag. Shut the f*** up. Why are you talking when you’re a woman?” |  | His behaviour was loud, threatening and sustained throughout the journey and it made everyone around him feel extremely unsafe. | What I (and others) did: | I (along with at least four other passengers) alerted the FlixBus driver multiple times. | Upon arrival at UK Border Control, we formally reported the abuse, including the physical violence and strangulation. | Despite our clear and repeated warnings, NO ACTION was taken by either the driver or Border Force officials. | The man was allowed to remain on board and freely disembark at London Victoria, where he continued verbally abusing his partner in public. | How FlixBus handled it afterward: | I reached out to FlixBus immediately after the journey. I provided a detailed account, submitted a police report and requested a refund (€37.99) alongside clear action: |  | Ban this dangerous man permanently from FlixBus services. | Explain your safeguarding policies and how you’ll prevent this in the future. | Instead, FlixBus… | Repeatedly cut me off in their live chat. | Failed to read or respond properly to my messages and the police report. | Sent me stock responses about “delays at the Channel Tunnel” and claimed they “couldn’t offer a refund because I used my ticket” – as if I was complaining about a late bus, not a serious case of assault and domestic violence on their service. | When I pushed for escalation, I was ignored or brushed off with scripted replies. | Refused to refund the journey or take accountability for their driver’s complete negligence. | Why I’m sharing this: | FlixBus put my safety and the safety of other passengers, at risk by doing absolutely nothing in the face of clear physical and verbal assault happening on their vehicle. | Their customer service is unempathetic, robotic and dismissive, even in response to serious incidents like this. | I have never felt more threatened or frightened in my life and the inaction from FlixBus made the situation even worse. | Despite my efforts, I have zero assurance that they will do anything to prevent this from happening to someone else."
Flixbus Global,"Bus was late, no updates, no refund",1,,2025-03-11T13:33:58.000Z,"Bus was late, but the status of the bus was ""on time"".

Flixbus Global,"Flixbus: """"We make mistakes, you pay for them"".",1,,2025-03-05T17:02:03.000Z,"I called the Flixbus helpline to ask how can I add a bicycle to my journey. The agent informed me that after booking, I can add this as ""additional luggage"". Right after booking, I saw that adding a bicycle is not an option. I found out that bicycles can only be added while booking, by selecting one passenger and one bike rack. This cannot be adjusted after the booking, not even via the customer service. |  | The customer service told me that I can only cancel my ticket and get a 40% refund, and book again with a bicycle. That means that I will lose 60% of my ticket price because the Flixbus agent provided incorrect information about how I can add a bike. I was informed that there are no exceptions for a refund or a voucher in this particular situation. So, the customer service holds me financially accountable for the mistake of their own agent. |  | The new slogan of Flixbus should be ""We make mistakes, you pay for them""."
Flixbus Global,Terrible and Discriminatory Experience with FlixBus,1,,2025-03-02T16:00:08.000Z,"I had an awful experience with FlixBus, when I was denied boarding on my trip from Berlin to Nykøbing F., despite having a valid ticket and traveling with my pre-approved service dog, Freja. The driver refused to let me on, even after I provided all necessary documents proving that Freja is a trained service dog. |  | To make matters worse, the staff at the FlixBus office in Berlin were unhelpful and misinformed, falsely claiming that only guide dogs for the blind were allowed. This is not only incorrect but also a violation of both EU law and FlixBus' own policies as stated on their website. |  | The entire experience was stressful, humiliating, and discriminatory. I was treated with disrespect and left stranded with no alternative transport options. I had to stay an extra day in Berlin to get a train ticket—at extra cost. |  | Flixbus has later on reimbursed me for the ticket I purchased with them, but denies all other responsibilities for the extra cost and stress associated with their breach of the EU Equal Treatment Directive and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. I strongly advise against using FlixBus if you are a disabled traveler who relies on a service dog."

The problem was that the bus was full of criminals, they were shouting and fighting, and the man beside us had a knife, he was drinking votka from a big bottle and was probably bringing drugs across the border, from what it looked like. |  | I don't think this is the fault of the company, but it was terrifying. We had two small children with us. I would recommend if you're a normal person just travelling with your family, always check where your bus is headed after your destination. If it's headed to a dangerous country, you're basically stepping into that country for the duration of your bus ride, even if that's not your destination. |  | I think that flixbus is aware of that because even the drivers knew it, they were arguing with some passengers and you could tell that it is just an everyday thing for them. I don't know what a pragmatic solution would be, because it wouldn't be politically correct to write on their webpage ""this line might be full of criminals"", but here I am letting you know. Be very careful if you're booking with flixbus, always check what the final destination of your bus is!"

To my great disappointment, these seats were not accessible and were blocked off with a seatbelt, as shown in the photo I took.

Flixbus Global,Coach cancellations,2,,2025-02-22T13:13:49.000Z,"This review is specifically based on the second time that me and my boyfriend travelled to France from England using Flixbus. Our expectations were not extremely high, as, the first time, two out of the three coaches had no toilets or wifi, which was a disappointment. So, we were pleasantly surprised to find that the first two today had both of these. However, by the time we had gotten to the ferry, things started to go downhill. The driver didn’t seem to know what was going on, and, when we were meant to be boarding the ferry at around two thirty am we were told we would have to wait until almost four, then we ended up setting off at three thirty. Alone, this wouldn’t have been too much of an issue; mistakes happen with any company. However, many people (including us) had coaches after the ferry that we would have missed if the times had been correct, causing unnecessary panic, and there was little to no communication by the driver. Though, the worst came after we arrived to wait for our last coach. Not that this is the company’s fault, but we had been travelling for almost 20 hours straight at this point, and still had an almost five hour coach ahead, so being told ten minutes before the coach was due to arrive, after already having been waiting for three hours, that it would be cancelled, we were pretty fed up. Obviously, these kinds of things happen, but the notice was extremely short, and me and my boyfriend were not impressed with how the situation was handled. Everyone was given a free trip on the next available coach to their destination, aside from us. Since we had come from France in one long trip, the worker couldn’t figure out how to give us a free trip only on the last coach, so he said that he would send off a request to people to get us (potentially) on the next coach (which would’ve been four hours later if we even made it onto that one). We were told to sit and wait for an email, which never came. Whilst we appreciate the kindness of the worker, and acknowledge that this wasn’t his fault, it felt unprofessional and tiring. After a while of waiting with nothing, I informed him that we would be getting a refund and finding the money to travel by train. He convinced me multiple times to wait a bit longer, until he finally cancelled the request and told me to call customer service, to which my refund was granted (to be delivered in 13 working days.) | This experience has certainly left a bad taste in our mouths, and we will be looking into other options in the future."
Flixbus Global,Misconduct and Unofficial Charges on Bus Journey | Booking Number: 3231392545,1,,2025-02-22T09:23:21.000Z,"Sharing my email to Flix which describe sour bad experience: | Dear Sirs, |  | I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding an incident that occurred during our journey on February 18, 2025, from Delhi to Prayagraj. Below are the journey details: |  | • Bus Number: UK07PA6150 | • Operator: Vivek Travels | • Line Code: IN 0426 | • Host Number: 89538-92637 | • Seat Numbers: 5A, 6A | • Scheduled Drop Point: Nawabganj Toll Bypass |  | Due to reported congestion and commuting difficulties at Nawabganj Toll Bypass caused by the Maha Kumbh rush, we requested the bus crew (driver and helper/marshal) to drop us at Sahson Chauraha, another bus stop in Prayagraj, which was along the same route as the bus continued towards Varanasi. |  | However, the crew informed us that changing the drop location would incur a penalty of ₹500 per person. When we inquired whether this was an official charge and if we would receive a receipt, they claimed it was official but that no receipt would be provided, and the payment had to be made in cash. |  | Upon further discussion, we made it clear that we were willing to pay any officially documented charge but would not agree to an unreceipted cash transaction. At this point, the crew (two drivers and the helper/marshal) became aggressive, started shouting at us, and misbehaved. They even threatened that they would not stop at Sahson Chauraha and would instead take us to Varanasi. |  | An elderly couple traveling with us (seated at 6B & 6C) also intervened, finding the charges unreasonable and the behavior unacceptable. However, despite our collective resistance, the crew continued to intimidate us. Ultimately, the four of us had no choice but to pay a total of ₹2,000 (₹500 per person) in cash. |  | Additionally, when we stated that we would be filing a complaint against their misconduct and misbehavior, they carelessly dismissed our concerns, showing no fear of accountability. |  | To support our complaint, we are attaching a photo showing two of the three bus crew members involved in this incident. Unfortunately, we do not have the contact details of the elderly couple, but we urge you to verify this incident by retrieving their information. | This experience was deeply disappointing and distressing. Such misbehavior, intimidation, and exploitation are completely unacceptable—especially from a reputed brand like FlixBus. |  | We request the following actions: |  | 1. A thorough investigation into this incident. | 2. Appropriate disciplinary action against the crew involved. | 3. A full refund of the unauthorized charge we were forced to pay. | 4. A formal response detailing the measures taken to prevent such incidents in the future. |  | We expect a prompt resolution to this matter and look forward to your response. |  | Best regards, | Dinesh Yadav | Damyanti Yadav (Senior Citizen) | Booking Number: 3231392545"

We discover the bus will be delayed until 3:46pm and decide to run some errands. Unexpectedly, at 2:40pm, we notice the bus arrive in the distance and circle around to quickly intercept it. Now-parked in front of the bus, my son jumps out, clamber’s over a snowbank, and proceeds to communicate with driver who confirms the bus destination for London. He then closes the bus doors as to prepare for boarding, but instead, drives away!! | The driver leaves my kid in a snowbank!!! | Shocked. I chase him in my car, hoping he’ll stop, but he pulls onto the highway and he’s gone. | WTH!!! | My son calls Flixbus to complain but cel phones don’t work well in Canadian winters, instead he must now purchase another ticket for the 3:40pm bus. Meanwhile other passengers arrive at the new delayed time to discover that their driver, has created his own schedule and has left! Several passengers cannot purchase another ticket and they’re DECLINED entry by the next driver. | Super Angry! We call the company and they block our calls for using swear words! (Imagine, if this was your kid...) Flixbus ultimately acknowledges their error and refunds one of the tickets only. | This is a significant health and safety concern. You cannot leave your passengers stranded in remote locations, Particularly in Arctic conditions!!! | I absolutely do not recommend using this company. If they cannot take full accountability for their irresponsible drivers, it will happen again! |  | 1. Think twice before leaving a loved one in-trust with their drivers. | 2.

Other incidents also occurred too numerous to mention, but I recorded most of them. I hope the company contact me and sack him. Use this company at your peril ! |  | After reading their bog standard reply, and with no action being taken towards their driver…Beware !! I think this sums up the attitude of FlixBus. They seem to have no consideration for the safety of their passengers. They have not contacted me personally or asked to see the video footage. Book at your peril"

Flixbus Global,My A Horrible Experience with FlixBus and Terrible Customer Service Terrible Experience with FlixBus,1,,2025-02-03T16:59:14.000Z,"I want to share my horrifying experience with FlixBus. A few weeks ago, my young son and I were traveling by FlixBus from a city in Germany to Frankfurt Airport. Unfortunately, I didn’t have much experience with this bus service. We had a flight to Turkey, and when we arrived at Frankfurt Airport, I took a few minutes to put on my son’s jacket and hat, as well as my own. |  | In those few moments, the bus started moving again. A ticket inspector came to check the tickets, and when I explained that I was supposed to get off at the airport and therefore didn’t have a ticket for the next destination, he reacted in an extremely aggressive and rude manner in front of my son. He insisted that I had to pay a hefty fine. At the next stop, he refused to let us get off and even called multiple police officers onto the bus, falsely claiming that we had boarded without a ticket. |  | I was in complete shock and couldn’t even speak, while my son was shaking with fear. In the end, we were forced to pay a €120 fine. When I protested and showed them our flight tickets, they simply told me to file a complaint to get my money back. However, despite contacting FlixBus customer service multiple times, my complaints went nowhere. |  | This terrifying experience still haunts both me and my son. I am deeply disappointed by FlixBus and their disrespectful treatment of passengers. I would never use this company again and strongly advise others to be cautious when choosing their services."

Flixbus Global,"Reliable, yet cheap long-distance transport",5,,2025-01-27T21:03:39.000Z,"Flixbus offers reliable and affordable services with an extensive network of routes. The buses are in general clean and well-equipped (services included are listed on the website when searching connections), but there may be a variability on different routes, especially when using different partner companies. | What I dislike is the separate sale of seat reservations - not very practical for this kind of transport."
Flixbus Global,Absolutely horrible,1,,2025-01-27T19:19:52.000Z,"Absolutely horrible, DO NOT RECOMMEND. |  | The bus stopped working in the middle of the night and we had to wait several hours while the heating stopped working in the bus. | Around 1am the driver said that the motor does not work and kicked us out of the bus. | I had to wait several hours in the middle of the night in -2 celsius for a train to get to the airport since I had to be home the next day. | The driver said that Flixbus will reimburse any alternative transportation, INCLUDING plane flights. I asked him about it specifically. | I contacted the customer support for my promised reimbursement and suddenly they’re saying that they do not reimburse these alternative transportations. |  | I’m highly disappointed. Not only did I freeze in the cold for several hours and get sick, but they also haven’t reimbursed ANY of the transportation. |  | Absolutely horrible. |  | Next time just bite the bullet and get a train or plane ticket. Flixbus is not trustable. |  | Additionally: Plug socket was broken. Air conditioning didn’t work while we were waiting for the bus to work again. Cold. Toilet had no toilet paper and was dirty. Random ppl were sitting in my reserved seat. Seats are not comfortable and smelled weird | -> what are u even paying for at this point? Bad experiences?"

Flixbus Global,Disgusting service,1,,2025-01-27T00:43:41.000Z,"Frankly, I found the behaviour of the coach driver on today's service absolutely despicable. |  | He was extremely rude to the passengers, exclaiming on the microphone that we took 'too long' to find our seats, and that we need to 'hurry up'. |  | Not only was he rude to passengers, but seemingly to other Flix staff when the respite driver was late at the changeover location. |  | Finally, he was particularly rude to an elderly passenger who had fallen ill on the service. Saying it wasn't his fault that she was unwell and that she should just 'take a seat now'. |  | The conduct of the driver was wholly unprofessional, and I have never experienced such discontent toward customers in any industry, not just in transport."

When it was 5 min after the set departure time I looked online to see the bus status and it said it had already stopped and left. I was waiting the whole time watching the road and there was no bus. I called customer service and they told me the same thing I saw online (a bright green bus arrived and departed on time). Customer service hung up on me when I asked to speak to someone else who wasn’t just going to read information off the website. I also submitted a refund request which they denied. | I took the same bus, same time the week before and had no issues. A bright green bus arrived on time at the designated location. This week it did not and customer service refuses to help or give any compensation. | It was also a round trip and the only advice customer service had for the return bus was to cancel it and receive a partial (40%) refund."

Flixbus Global,A very smooth drive and a Comfortable Coach,4,,2025-01-23T13:07:04.000Z,"The whole setup of coaches outside Bergamo airport is fantastic and well structured. Flix bus operates a range of comfortable coaches which is amazing and they have usb charging points for your devices. | The driver was careful and helpful both before and after the journey. | The only slight negative was the delay to the start of the journey as the bus didn't arrive on time for our departure, hence the one point deduction from the overall rating score. Other than that it is a highly recommended mode of intercity transfer when in Italy."

Flixbus Global,The Greyhound was terrible,1,,2025-01-24T13:48:45.000Z,"The Greyhound was terrible. The Flixbus was great. The first Greyhound driver was extremely fatigued and kept swerving extremely dangerously. The second Greyhound driver almost didn't let me back on the bus because I made an innocent mistake and then apparently gave her attitude by trying to explain my mistake as I complied and when I took a deep breath after she started yelling at me. I asked her why she was being so rude to me and the security guard told me to just be quiet and say yes so that I could get back on the bus to get back to my personal belongings and computer and to continue to my destination. I will absolutely never ride a Greyhound again, which is a shame for Flixbus because they're great. I will be taking Amtrak from now on. |  | Edit: I cannot believe that you are now actually asking me over email for video evidence of all of this. You should have functional security cameras, unless you are telling me that those don't work too. Plus, my phone cannot take 9 hours of video, much less see how strongly we all kept getting jerked around and woken up by this fatigued driver, in THE DARK. Are you sideways asking me to have unbuckled my seatbelt, walk to the front of the bus, stand by the fatigued driver, and take video of him and the road in front? That is insane. That is not my responsibility. You should have cameras on the outside, as well as maybe making sure the cameras on the inside actually work."
Flixbus Global,Useless service,1,,2025-01-23T05:07:30.000Z,Useless service. Cancelled my ticket on the same day 55 days in advance and didn’t get my refund. Customer service also very unhelpful and nonchalant about this. Last time will be using this service.

Then I chose another seat but had to leave it at the next bus stop because someone else had reserved the very seat I was in. |  | Besides that I noticed the other driver being extremely rude to another passenger and yelling at him just because he didn't understand he should get in through the rear door.

Flixbus Global,The bus drivers left me stranded,1,,2025-01-20T15:28:38.000Z,"The bus drivers left me stranded at a rest stop. I was at least in the same state I wanted to be in. Usually they don't ask everyone to get off the bus, but this time they did. Unfortunately the drivers didn't announce how long the stop was, do a head count before they pulled off, or announce the bus is pulling off. I talked to someone on the bus but I was traveling alone so no one said anything or noticed my empty seat. I guess as long as the drivers are getting paid they don't care what happens to the passengers. Fortunately, my girlfriend got my bags from the bus at my scheduled stop and was able to rescue me from the rest stop. This was my last trip with Flix."

So I re-booked the trip for Dec 27, 2024 5:15 am. I waited in the cold only to be messaged that the trip was cancelled around 5:50 am of the same day!

Flixbus Global,FlixBus - Misleading Seat Reservations and Unhelpful Driver,1,,2025-01-19T14:07:10.000Z,"I recently had a very negative experience with FlixBus. I booked and paid extra for specific seats, which turned out to be non-existent on the bus. |  | The driver was unhelpful and dismissive, and I was left to deal with the situation myself. This led to an embarrassing encounter with other passengers who had also booked the same non-existent seats. |  | The entire experience was frustrating and upsetting. I paid extra for specific seats to ensure a comfortable journey, but instead I was met with inconvenience and poor customer service. |  | FlixBus needs to address its misleading booking system and ensure that drivers are properly trained to handle such situations. Clearly, paying extra for seat reservations with FlixBus is a waste of money."
Flixbus Global,Abandoned after notice of bus delay,1,,2025-01-19T11:02:03.000Z,"Received a text notice & app update that the bus would be leaving half an hour late. It was the last bus on a cold night so I opted to show up 15 min before the new departure time instead of 15 min before the original time. Turns out the bus left without me at nearly the original time, and no updates were provided to alert riders to the change. So I guess don’t believe what flix tells you about bus delays, because they will lie, abandon you, and offer no refunds or rescheduling. Other passengers were also stranded, so I was not the only one affected by this issue. I have been riding flix buses for years and am so angry about this experience that I would rather deal with the delays & inconvenience of Amtrak going forward than give another cent to flix. For how much they charge for tickets you’d think they’d have better customer service, but they truly do not care whether passengers live or die."

Flixbus Global,Rude Driver experience,2,,2025-01-16T12:19:35.000Z,"Me and my Mom went for a trip to Edinburgh, and the return back home to London was not a pleasant journey. The driver was rude in asking us to move seats because apparently in his records the seats shouldn't be occupied. I have pre-paid the seats and it's in our ticket (pdf and app) and I showed him, but still he says we should've moved because it's the legal rule. He accuses us of sneaking inside the bus and not showing/scanning our tickets where in fact, he was the one who checked our ticket in the queue in Edinburgh Station - all happened in the middle of the journey. It was appalling and I don't think I'm going for Flixbus anymore. I've tried it for the first time and I'm sticking with National Express Coach or trains if I'm travelling to Scotland."
Flixbus Global,Believe the bad reviews,1,,2025-01-15T20:49:43.000Z,"When the reviews say bad things, believe them. When that refund policy basically says, ""No matter what happens, the only thing we can do is have you continue to ride the same miserable bus service"" believe them. When you see that 12-14 hour transit time, add roughly 3-5 more hours. Don't take flexbus."

Flixbus Global,The worst trip,1,,2025-01-15T19:51:36.000Z,The worst trip
Flixbus Global,Bus was one and half hours late,1,,2025-01-17T14:52:09.000Z,"Update: flixbus have said the matter has been closed internally! Maybe so but I am not happy. I submitted a form for bus delay under 2 hours but since they claim I didn’t submit a cancellation form that I am not entitled to any refund! They do not follow their own policies and use anything to not pay. | It’s only a tenner refund but they would rather lose a customer and have bad reviews. On top of that they claim I never submitted my form till 2pm (too late) when I have evidence I submitted it at 1pm. Let’s be clear flixbus.. I did not miss my bus, your bus was an hour and a half late and I submitted my form around half hour before departure!!! |  | Bus was one and half hours late. I had to book another bus to get to my destination on time. They are refusing to refund me or refund the other bus ticket because it was less than 2 hours delay. Awful bus service and policies are difficult and complicated. Ember bus is so much easier to cancel, refund unused tickets no problem. I will use ember from now on. Never again will I book flixbus."

Flixbus Global,My luggage was lost,1,,2025-01-29T11:31:17.000Z,"My luggage was lost. You should have a baggage claim control system. From what I've seen, people just take whatever they want and no one checks. They took my bag, I told the driver and he said there was nothing he could do. He dropped me off at my destination at 10:15 p.m., in the cold, -4°, in a place that had no roof or structure to provide customer support. Disappointing, inhumane, absolutely absurd. |  | I am helpless, with no hope of finding/unpacking my luggage, and no clothes. |  | ............. | Atualizada. |  | After 14 days of agonizing waiting, I received a standard email informing me that they had not found my luggage and that, if they did, they would contact me. The email said the following: |  | ""After consulting with our lost and found offices and our bus partners, we regret to inform you that your lost item has not yet been delivered to one of our offices. If the item is found later, we will contact you immediately."" |  | My luggage, which was clearly marked with all my details, lock and tags, simply disappeared from the luggage compartment of this company's bus. And this is the vague and unsatisfactory response I have received so far. |  | In another email, they said that they would refund the ticket, but to this day I have not received any amount or any information about the process. The email I received about the refund was a standard template, without even asking for the necessary information to make the payment. |  | This situation is truly disorganized, and I extremely regret having trusted this company to make my dream trip happen. What should have been a pleasant experience turned into a nightmare, with no support and full of disappointment. |  | My luggage, with all my belongings, was lost from the luggage compartment of your bus during the trip. Do you have any idea of the despair, anguish and stress this caused me? And the worst part: until now, I have not received the slightest support to deal with this situation. |  | The amount of the ticket refund does not guarantee due compensation for the tremendous discomfort, the damage caused by the loss of my belongings and the insecurity that was imposed on me. |  | In addition, I must state that I do not recommend the company to anyone, as the lack of organization and care with luggage is evident. The company urgently needs to improve the control of luggage delivery and collection during trips. Basic procedures are missing, such as identification papers or delivery receipts, which would ensure greater security and transparency for passengers. |  | In view of this, I await the receipt of the ticket refund as promised, as well as the letter formalized by the company, informing me of the definitive loss of the luggage. I hope the company takes the necessary steps to resolve this situation appropriately, fairly and as quickly as possible."
Flixbus Global,Unreliable when under booked,1,,2025-01-15T08:24:19.000Z,First they postponed the the departure with half an hour thenn another half an hour after which they cancelled the ride entirely. Would not recommend to use flixbus as a reliable form of transportation since they might cancel at under booking. We were waiting outside in minus six. The only other option we had was to get a taxi for 300 euro so we would not miss our connection.

Flixbus Global,For Ease of Traveling,1,,2025-01-14T22:13:25.000Z,"For Ease of Traveling, Use anything else BUT Flixbus! I was traveling Thursday to Philly for a funeral on Saturday. I was emotional and didn't want to deal with the stress of driving my own car. Flixbus offered great pricing and when I saw that it was connected with Greyhound, I felt comfortable and confident in my decision to book because I had never had a bad experience with Greyhound before (before the bankruptcy). My first concern was that the bus stop was a literal parking lot with no shelter (cold/snow), but there was a random ""holding"" bus where you could wait until your bus arrived...Different, but Ok. I found that the actual bus I was riding on did not have USB charging ports, just plug-ins. Fine, whatever...I'll just purchase a cube when we get to a stop with a store. It was late Thursday night, I didn't require much and the trip was going smoothly. |  | And then we get to Pittsburgh. The bus driver tells us all that we can leave our luggage on the bus and that there's going to be an hour layover while they switch drivers, clean and gas the bus...again, not a problem, layovers are necessary. He gets back on the bus and tells us that the replacement driver called in sick and that we would have to wait for another driver AND bus. So everyone collected their items, luggage and we wait in the lobby. The driver was asked repeatedly if there was an ETA on when we could expect another bus and driver: ""It could be an hour...it could be more"" was all he said before he bolted with the bus. |  | Over the course of 5 hours, some people were able to switch their tickets to other busses. I was not due to only having wifi on my phone, so I could not call to get assistance with mine. When asking the few employees of the station any questions, no one knew anything...Not even the person who later assisted with ticket changes for a select few. The Kiosk in the station was either broken or just not working because several of were told to use that, only to find that we couldn't. It's 3am...people are tired, and no one is getting any answers. The departure signs were also of no help. I was finally able to use someone else's phone and when I spoke to the CSR agent, she had the nerve to argue with me that the bus I was on, was showing on their end as being in Harrisburg and on-time. To which I responded: ""well, the bus might show on your end that it's in Harrisburgh, but for those of us who were originally on it, WE are still in Pittsburgh. Apparently due to the system showing that my bus was on-time and where it was supposed to be, nothing could be done for me to get it switched and the only other options available to me were to either remain stuck in Pittsburgh's terminal ALL DAY until another bus was available that Friday evening, or being put on another bus that was leaving Saturday morning. |  | There was more to the debacle, but I'm going to hold onto my inner peace right now and just let that go...We did end up getting onto a 6:05am bus, but the driver's instructions of ""stand over there against the wall out of the way"" and constant responses of ""I'm gonna let you get on, but first, I'm gonna take care of MY passengers"" was unnerving. Especially when we were not there by choice and were being forced to make an unfortunate decision. |  | Finally made it to Philly, but this whole experience has left a very bad taste that I would hope that if you have means to travel via any other form, you should probably do it, until all of the reviews for Flixbus start reflecting a more positive customer/rider experience."

Its even wasn't green, it was old, without any charging spots. I was waiting for the green ""FLIXBUS"" bus at the same place where he is parking at the all time. God bless my wife, because, time was 7:06+-, bus should be at the placr 7:10. She suggested me to lets check the rest of bus'es. And what was my surprise when I saw the wrong bus, wrong place, but the correct bus number. I bought special seat for myself and of course its was taken and no one was interested in that. Driver said everyone: 'take free seats'. Then why i should buy special seats? Just want my money back for that what I even not used."

Flixbus Global,Bus delay led to miss of connection bus,1,,2025-01-14T16:49:24.000Z,"First, know that I am reviewing a single trip and things like this may happen always. About the trip: First trip was 1.5 hours and I had to change the bus. But the first bus was late so I arrived 35 minutes later than planned and missed my connection by a few minutes. As a result I had to buy new tickets, spend one very cold day on the road and postponed my travel with a day. My wish is that FlixBus make a function where you can log a delay instantly so your connection bus could wait for you (for a reasonable amount of time, let's say 5-10min) or your ticket could at least be changed for a future trip of this kind upon availability in the upcoming day/week."

The 2nd driver smoked whilst he was driving between Konya - Antalya! I was sitting in seat number 1 directly behind him and started coughing as his smoke upset me! I have never smoked and had believed that 'ALL' smoking was banned on Flixbus. Especially by their own staff? If other passengers had noticed him smoking? They would have also started smoking on the bus! That one single issue, of their staff ignoring the health and safety of their passengers. Is the only problem which I believe they should stop!!! It made what was a pleasant journey for me, an uncomfortable journey!!!"

Seemed really cheap. |  | The outbound journey turned out to be a replacement coach, meaning there was no working wifi, and no one had put reserved signs on any of the seats, so I had an aisle seat and spent money on nothing. I mentioned this to the driver and he was dismissive and argumentative, acting like seat reservations for Flixbus didn't exist. I tried to get a refund for the reservation (the refund should be automatic, ideally), but there was no email you could use, and the Flixbus website wouldn't work with my mobile - the menus kept taking me in circles. |  | With the return journey, just as I was about to board I found an email to say my coach had been cancelled, with no explanation. I sat in the cold bus station and tried to switch for a later Flixbus coach, and there didn't seem to be one an hour later, the next one was two hours later. I didn't fancy freezing my nuts off for two hours and get home 2 hours late so I was forced to fork out for a National Express coach at short notice."

And there was no information about delay /cancellation of the trip in Flixbus app, no updated information on departure tablo at the bus stop (only that the the bus is ON TIME!!). I am very disappointed. I had to go by train. My tickets are gone without compensation."

Flixbus Global,This agency is the worst ever,1,,2025-01-09T12:51:51.000Z,"This agency is the worst ever. Left from Strasbourg to Berlin with a connection via Dresden, forgot my black bagpack in the upper cabin in the bus Route 321A heading to Prague on 8 January 2025, after I hop off in Dresden. I contacted the online customer service immediately, they asked me to fill the lost and found form. Done!. Again I remembered I could catch with them in Prague, went there and they were closed for the day. The next morning, I called the customer service same story. Arrived at the bus station to meet with the staff I was asked to wait for the same bus leaving at 10:40 am. I checked inside the bus my bagpack wasn't there. I'm so depressed at this moment. All my keys, laptop, and my medication all gone?? Plus the drivers were not friendly and very rude. I can't give up on this."
Flixbus Global,I've had nothing but good experiences…,5,,2025-01-09T12:19:10.000Z,"I've had nothing but good experiences with Flixbus, and I've travelled with them at least a dozen times.

Flixbus Global,"Inadequate bus driver, broken WC, internet and seat numbers",1,,2025-01-09T01:39:37.000Z,"Bus driver was extremely rude to customers, denying seat reservations due to seat numbers being absent on this particular bus, overheating saloon with air conditioning, rudely rebuking people asking for toilet (which was unavailable for the entirety of this trip), circling around towns aimlessly and stopping in the middle of the road causing us being late for no particular reason. I almost lost my train connection due to 23 minute delay. And I was quite stressed because of the atmosphere caused by this driver. I don't want to use flixbus again after that."
Flixbus Global,FlixBus – Poor Experience Due to Delays and Unresponsive Customer Service,1,,2025-01-08T22:56:53.000Z,"I’ve been a regular FlixBus customer, but after my recent experience, I feel compelled to share my frustrations. |  | I booked a return trip with FlixBus on 20th October 2024, referencing booking number 3204082271 for my second journey. Unfortunately, the outbound bus was delayed by 45 minutes—it was scheduled to depart at 16:45 but left at 17:30, arriving at 19:30 instead of the scheduled 18:35. |  | This delay had a major impact on my plans. I was in London to collect my swapped luggage from the airport, and I needed to return to Leicester in time to get some urgent work done. The delay caused me to miss an important appointment, and I was unable to complete my tasks as planned. I asked the driver about changing my booking to a later bus, and while I was told this could be done online, the online portal was unhelpful. I couldn’t change the booking because the option was unavailable. |  | After trying for several hours, I attempted to contact customer service. Unfortunately, after calling 10-15 times, I was met with nothing but an automated system that disconnected each time. No actual agent responded until days after the trip when I contacted them again regarding the same, which felt like a lack of urgency. |  | Due to the circumstances, I had to purchase another ticket for a later bus, which was an additional cost. When I requested a refund for the ticket I couldn’t use, I was disappointed to receive a response stating they could not issue a refund because the delay was under two hours (despite the inconvenience it caused). This felt like a poor response to what was a completely avoidable situation, where their system and support failed me. |  | It’s frustrating that FlixBus couldn’t provide a solution during such a critical time. Given my loyalty as a customer, I expected much better service, especially when delays and technical issues were out of my control."

Flixbus Global,They Don’t care about clients,1,,2025-01-11T21:39:27.000Z,"Whenever bus arrived, because it was night and in the bus was not enough lights on, I haven’t seen that I left my glasses in the pocket in front of my sit. I left the bus, and after 5 minutes came back and wasn’t able to find the bus, I came with. I asked many drivers to help, but no one wanted to help me. I wrote message to the “help service” about losing luggage, but already 2 weeks , and no response. They absolutely don’t give a shit about their clients. | Moreover, sometimes ( in another trips with FlixBus) during the way through Belgium , some illegal foreigners jumped to the bus and easily transported to another country. No one even checked them. So, it’s absolutely not safe there. Sometimes, I saw fights between of middle eastern passengers on the bus-stop also in Belgium. Also, it was absolutely not clear where the place to stop for FlixBus in the Enschede, I was worried a lot, no single sign on the station about Flixbus stop in the Enschede. |  | P.S.: I got a response, eyeglasses were not found. But hopefully some service will be fixed."
Flixbus Global,The worst experience ever,1,,2025-01-08T20:27:36.000Z,"On Dec 23rd we were supposed to take a bus from Berlin to Poznan, but it was 90 minutes delayed. Another flixbus to Poznan arrived on time, and the driver advised us that if we bought tickets for his bus instead, we could travel with him and we would then get a refund for the delayed bus. We did so, and immediately requested a refund online, but the customer service was useless and they said they would only refund us if the bus was delayed 120 minutes. We've been exchanging emails for 3 weeks now and they won't take responsibility for their driver's error. We will have to take it further. We feel so deceived and disappointed, we'll never travel with them again."

Flixbus Global,This was a much too long and terrible…,1,,2025-01-08T04:21:52.000Z,"This was a much too long and terrible bustrip. the bus drivers who completed the journey were rude, unfriendly and incompetent. they only spoke Ukrainian, while I speak Dutch, French, English and German it was impossible for me to enter into a dialogue with them. And then they also drove past the Cologne stop without stopping, which meant they had to turn back and the ride took another 2 hours longer, while we had all been stuck at border control for 24 hours. unacceptable!"
Flixbus Global,Rude Driver and Unsafe Practices Ruined Our Trip,1,,2025-01-07T23:53:08.000Z,"The only reason I gave 1 star is that the bus arrived on time for both our departure and return trips. |  | Unfortunately, the overall experience was very disappointing, mainly due to the drivers—especially the one on our departure trip from downtown Toronto to Niagara Falls. His behavior was rude and unprofessional. My wife and I paid extra for 'first class' seats to have the additional legroom I need as a tall person. However, when we boarded the bus, we found the driver's personal belongings in our reserved seats. |  | When we showed him our tickets, he not only refused to acknowledge our rightful seats but also made a scene in front of the entire bus, saying things like, ""I hate first class,"" and ""Now you have to sit behind me,"" as though we had chosen to inconvenience him. We only wanted to sit in the seats we paid for. |  | Reluctantly, we moved to the seats behind the driver, which were less comfortable. To make matters worse, the driver watched the news on his phone, which he had propped on the steering column while driving. This was extremely unsafe and made the experience even more unsettling. |  | Our return trip back to Toronto was better but still unsettling given the driver tailgated and beeped at other drivers the whole trip. We did not have any luggage but we saw him throw other people's luggage around in the storage space under the bus. |  | I was deeply disappointed by this experience overall and will not be using this bus line again."

Flixbus Global,Internet issues,3,,2025-01-07T14:58:21.000Z,"I like this company and its service but with the frequent internet connection issues during the trip you should connect and disconnect many times, and on some buses, there is no Wi-Fi at all, simply you should activate the roaming service at your own cost."
Flixbus Global,Dangerous ignorance of the driver,3,,2025-01-07T13:30:32.000Z,"Dangerous ignorance of the driver! He did not talk with clients, then charged a few passengers cash and had not enough space for ticket holders who bought online. Ticket holders could NOT enter the bus, GREAT ANGER at the bus door! Driver talked 30 minutes (!) very loud all the time during the ride with a girl passenger in their other language, until I told him I am afraid of the safety. Extremely annoying. He laughed about my comment and only stopped a few minutes later talking."

Flixbus Global,Amazing first experience,5,,2025-01-07T09:42:33.000Z,"I recently found myself stranded in Manchester due to severe weather, with no trains running. Desperate for a last-minute solution, I came across FlixBus online. It was my first time booking with them, and I was fortunate to secure one of the last three available seats. From start to finish, the experience was nothing short of amazing. |  | Booking was quick and effortless, and I appreciated how user-friendly the process was. The coach itself was clean, comfortable, and perfectly temperature-controlled, making the ride incredibly relaxing. |  | While waiting for my bus, I noticed two other FlixBus coaches departing for London. What stood out most to me was how friendly and professional the staff were—both the drivers and their assistants. Everyone seemed genuinely happy to be doing their job, which added a personal touch to the overall experience. When my bus finally arrived, it was no different—the staff were polite, welcoming, and professional throughout the journey. |  | This positive first experience has completely changed my perspective on coach travel. |  | I wouldn’t hesitate to use FlixBus again in the future, especially when I have more time to plan. FlixBus turned what could have been a stressful and uncomfortable situation into a smooth, pleasant journey."
Flixbus Global,unprofessional behaviour,1,,2025-01-08T16:41:13.000Z,Travelling from Brussels North station to Eindhoven central. The driver's attitude is bad as his driving. This driver must quit his job if he is unhappy or else he is ruining the reputation of other good drivers from Flixbus.
Flixbus Global,Seats to small and sweltering cabin tempature. The air vents weren't working up to par.,3,,2025-01-07T00:42:58.000Z,"I've never had to deal with assigned seatting on a bus and the person was mad that he had to move his coat and bag. I wanted my seat. The heat was horrible people were coughing and I couldn't get comfortable. Once we got near Union station in DC, it was snowing and we were unable to get to the garage to be dropped off. Never made it to our destination and had to walk up the hill. By the time I got to my vehicle in the garage, I ended up having to pay more money to park because of tardiness. This trip need to be reimbursed."
Flixbus Global,FLIX  - a BASIC experience.,3,,2025-01-06T22:10:49.000Z,"For a long journey( MIA/TPA from SRQ for example ) there are NO toilet and coffee stops available. There is a toilet on board but many customers prefer to use other outside facility. On this particular journey, heating not working so bus was freezing. many passengers complained with all above. Bus is never warm at the best of times. BE PREPARED !"
Flixbus Global,My bus scheduled at 9:10 am to Toronto…,1,,2025-01-08T00:15:26.000Z,My bus scheduled at 9:10 am to Toronto airport didn’t show up. My husband and I was at the bus stop 30 minutes before 9:10 am to make sure I don’t miss it. Then I received an email stating that my bus at 9:10 was delayed and will arrive at 10:27am. So waited and waited until 11:00 am and the bus didn’t come. I have no choice for to do a rush buying of new bus ticket to Toronto airport right at tge bus stop. The driver of Bus 2710 was kind enough to wait for me to finish my new purchase of ticket so I can board on his bus stop at 11:40 am. or else I will miss my flight going to other country. My old bus ticket was 3216873519 and my new bus ticket is 3222572748. They can’t refund my old ticket because in their system it shows that the bus arrived on time at 9:10 and left on time and the passenger which is me has boarded the bus. I don’t understand it. So I’m so pissed that this situation is happening. I’ve been traveling for more than 30 years. This is the first time I experienced this. I hope this will never happen again.

Flixbus Global,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE,1,,2025-01-06T08:16:29.000Z,"The bus was a disaster. Totally disorganized, no one respected their seats and the bus was nasty, even a seat was totally wet by pee. There wasn’t any kind of security, you have to look for your luggage and anyone could get into the bus.

If Flix want more details, please ask them to provide me with questions of there misunderstandings. | Ty | The bus driver’s behavior was downright unacceptable and infuriating! From the moment I approached him, he was rude and unwelcoming. Instead of greeting me or offering assistance, he immediately demanded to see my ticket. When I tried to confirm if I was even on the right bus, he blatantly ignored my question and again barked for my ticket. Only after much frustration did he finally answer me, and I showed him my ticket. |  | Thinking I could avoid further confrontation, I moved to the back of the line, assuming that my reservation guaranteed me a seat anyway. But no—halfway through boarding, this driver had the audacity to announce that reservations weren’t valid on HIS bus. When I questioned why my purchased reservation wasn’t honored, he arrogantly declared, “No reservations on MY bus.” His dismissive tone and lack of professionalism were maddening. |  | To top it all off, the last four rows of the bus reeked of putrid urine! How dare they think this was acceptable for paying passengers? This entire experience was beyond appalling, and I’m absolutely leaving a scathing review. Not only that—I’ll be demanding a full refund for this disgraceful service. Unbelievable!"

Flixbus Global,The behavior of the drivers was awful,1,,2025-01-04T23:47:09.000Z,"The behavior of the drivers was unprofessional and disrespectful. While I understand the need for instructions on maintaining the facilities, their communication was entirely inappropriate. After greeting us, they stated, “Don’t throw paper into the toilet, otherwise you will shit under yourselves.” Such language is unacceptable for a paid service, and a polite reminder would have been sufficient. |  | The drivers also showed little consideration for passengers' needs. Stops were so short that there wasn’t even time to grab tea or stretch, and they warned us: “If you’re not back in 5 minutes, we’ll leave without you. We’re not a plane!” While keeping a schedule is important, such rigidity on a 30+ hour journey was unnecessary. |  | To make matters worse, basic amenities like water to wash hands and Wi-Fi (which is included in the ticket price) were unavailable. Despite long delays at the border, the only extended stop was to pick up a private package, which raised concerns about whether this is even authorized. |  | Passengers were treated without respect, as if we were an inconvenience rather than paying customers. While I understand personal challenges or bad days, professionalism and dignity should still be maintained. |  | FlixBus was my only travel option during the holidays, and the tickets were far from cheap, which made this poor experience even more frustrating. I’ve also heard many similar complaints about FlixBus drivers, suggesting this is a widespread issue. I hope management addresses this to improve service quality for future travelers."

The bus driver called the other bus to wait, but after I had taken out my luggage, the bus had already left. What I like is the general experience of easy travelling, easy booking of extra luggage, and the possibility of finding another connection after the booked connection is lost"
Flixbus Global,Sofia Solun,5,,2025-01-03T14:20:45.000Z,"I choose FlixBus cause the buses tend to be cleaner and newer compared to the competition, that passengers may carry even livestock.. If I have to choose public transport, Flix is my preferred choice."

Flixbus Global,Driver was not nice,3,,2025-01-03T09:12:04.000Z,"Driver was not nice. Very rude and not helpful. | Other than that everything was good. |  | But yeah don’t ask him anything. He will make you feel stupid. |  | Eg. you stop at the city of your destination on a random bus stop, and ask is this the only stop in this city? And his answer is “check your ticket it has the address on there, it’s easy.” |  | The ticket did not have the address as it is an e ticket on the iPhone… I to go check my email while second guessing if we missed our stop at the city, note that the board at the front window of the bus had several cities written there, implying that it’s going to pass through all of them. |  | This might also be country related as they are cold people, but if you work with Public you have to have the minimum of kindness and be helpful. Also it was morning of 1 Jan, but we had like 3 interactions and every single one of those he has rude. Following day, same trip, same experience, thankfully we were now experts on FlixBus and we didn’t need guidance. But we saw 1 or 2 unlucky customers getting the especial treatment… this makes you think is it always like this ?"
Flixbus Global,“Terrible experience,1,,2025-01-02T22:46:21.000Z,"“Terrible experience. The driver was rude and aggressive, treating passengers disrespectfully and ignoring assigned seats.

Flixbus Global,Flix bus stole my luggage,1,,2025-01-02T02:36:45.000Z,"I showed up at the bus station on time and put my bags into the bus, meanwhile I was saying goodbye to my friends, the bus driver, without a notification, jumped into the bus and close the door in my face and drove away, I tried to catch the bus to next stop signal that was in the corner and the driver almost drove over me. I hit the front glass of the bus and she stopped. She never opened the door, just started doing phone calls and checking the bus computer. During a phone call she started laughing and asked me with her hands to move away, I made a step back and immediately she accelerate and drove away leaving me behind while all my belongings remained inside the bus. Despite my attempts to communicate with the driver, I received no assistance or appropriate response. Additionally, I was subjected to discriminatory behavior by the driver, who at one point before the incident asked for my passport to be able to take the bus, besides the threatening gesture with the vehicle, putting me in physical danger. This behavior displayed a clear lack of respect towards me, which I consider an act of racism. As a direct result of this incident, my belongings—including one suitcase containing personal and valuable items—have gone missing. They have not been located to date, causing a significant material loss and substantial inconvenience."
Flixbus Global,WORST DRIVER AND WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE,1,,2025-01-02T02:33:12.000Z,"We booked FlixBus from Detroit to Toronto. The Bus Driver didn’t know immigration laws and travel document requirements. We are lawful US permanent residents and we are aware of the immigration laws which states that US permanent residents do not require Canadian visa to travel via bus. But the bus driver kept saying “NO VISA NO CANADA” and made us to wait outside in freezing weather for 30 mins. He was extremely rude and didn’t want to acknowledge what we were saying, he just went inside the bus and locked himself and was about to leave without us. When we contacted customer service, the agent was not willing to speak to the driver and kept saying that “we don’t talk to bus drivers directly”. No one was willing to help us. We were 8 total passengers in the entire bus who had same issue."

Flixbus Global,"Generally, very reliable & fast. Rush hours & holiday delays are understandable.",3,,2024-12-31T20:07:22.000Z,"In today's world, there is no excuse for not having the most accurate, real-time information about the estimated time of arrival (ETA). I recommend that everyone plan to arrive at the departure station based on the scheduled departure time, rather than the ETA provided on the FlixBus website. For example, my bus ETA indicated a 30-minute delay. However, I made sure to arrive before the scheduled departure time, which proved beneficial because the bus was not delayed at all; it left just 4 minutes after the scheduled time. |  | While buses are typically late during rush hours, which is understandable, the overall service is reliable. |  | It's important to note that they tend to overbook during holidays. I have personally witnessed two passengers who had purchased two tickets and reserved their seats in advance to avoid sitting next to anyone. Unfortunately, due to the overbooking allowed by the FlixBus website, the bus driver forced them to sit next to other passengers, leaving them with no options."
Flixbus Global,"Poor communication about delays, BAD bus services",2,,2024-12-31T19:28:46.000Z,"Bus was ""severely delayed"" yet they did not let us know that until I had already traveled to the bus stop. Delays may not be under your control, but communication about it is! Wifi was not working for a 13 hour trip and the bathroom was out of order for a 13 hour trip. The bus had not been cleaned before it picked us up (lots of dirt/crumbs on the floor, trash in the seat pocket)."
Flixbus Global,Early departure,2,,2024-12-31T19:21:17.000Z,"I’ve used FlixBus a few times. While I’ve had no major issues before, my last experience made my overall rating at most 2 stars! |  | It was on November 21, with a scheduled departure time of 22:35. I arrived at the station at 22:30 and, completely by chance, noticed the bus. If I hadn’t been paying attention, they would have left me behind because they departed earlier than scheduled. This could cause significant troubles for me afterward. |  | When I managed to board the bus, I asked the driver why they left earlier than the scheduled time. Instead of providing an explanation, he rudely shouted the departure is at 22:30! However, my ticket clearly states the departure time as 22:35. |  | I am deeply dissatisfied and upset with the way the driver treated me. This behavior is unacceptable and reflects poorly on the service."

Flixbus Global,Nothing positive,1,,2024-12-31T12:52:54.000Z,"Nothing positive, overall we lost money from our 7:15 PM booking to Hamburg from Berlin where bus left exactly by 7:15 PM and later bus we booked for 10:45 pm came around an hour and 5 minutes late. Berlin is a cosmopolitan city so you need instructions and details sent via proper updates to world passengers promptly in English as well or I am not sure if this is one way of earning money by Flixbus from passengers who can neither read nor understand German. Overall, very bad experience and would not recommend my friends and family to book flixbus on their holiday trips in Germany. We reached the Berlin central bus stop on time for our 7:15 PM bus but we were in search of platform 50 instead of the platform where bus would come. If you had sent a message or an email or something at all saying your bus is on platform 9 we would have not missed boarding the bus, so your timely updates to passengers via SMS, email or mobile app updates Is utterly bad. One final feedback is ask the customer booking if they want ticket in English so they can at least understand the ticket they have bought. Even if you provide a feature to chat with driver or something before the bus departure would have been good. No one in the bus stand helped us find the platform where the 7:15 PM bus was. Again the above feedback is not frustration but poor user experience provided by flixbus, hope you read and understand. Again for passengers there is something called Route and Gate, Route is the number of route where the bus goes not sure if it has any significance and gate in their language is the platform we usually refer to in the UK. Would recommend trying to read and understand the German printed ticket properly so you don't miss boarding bus like us."

Flixbus Global,We booked a round-trip from my city to…,1,,2024-12-31T01:54:52.000Z,"We booked a round-trip from my city to the airport. When departing the bus arrived late which was normal in my experience with Flixbus and I don't mind waiting because I understand that things are sometimes out of their control but they do their best. Once returning to the airport and preparing for our departure back to our city we kept an eye out for the bus from inside because it was raining but when we didn't see it, we assumed it was just running behind schedule again. When it was the time of our departure we decided to go wait at the stop. It was at that very moment that we realized the bus that had been sitting there was actually ours. We didn't realize it before because we were looking for a green bus as we have always taken. This bus was white with a different company name printed largely on the side but as we went towards it we saw a small green square in the front that said Flixbus. As we walked towards the bus, it began to drive away, we waved to get the attention of the driver but he didn't stop. Our bus was set to arrive at 6:50 and that was the exact time it drove away. I immediately called customer service and after going through multiple prompts I connected with an agent to explain what had happened. She said there was nothing that she could do and that because my ticket was considered to be ""unused"" at that point she couldn't make any scheduling changes and that I would have to purchase a new ticket. However the next bus for that route wouldn't arrive until the following day so at that moment my daughter and I were left stranded at the airport. I've normally had good service using Flixbus and have tempered through small hiccups which as I said are sometimes out of their control, however I am EXTREMELY disappointed in them this time for their lack of help and/or compassion. I will definitely be looking into alternative options the next time I travel because of this. In the end, I understand that it is my responsibility as a customer to be on time but this was just a random misunderstanding on my part because I didn't know to look for a white bus with another company name on it. It would have been great if Flixbus would have given me a heads up or perhaps given just a few minutes (I don't expect anymore than 5) of leniency as we have for them multiple times. I am only writing this review to let people know what happened so that it doesn't happen to them as well."
Flixbus Global,Flixbus lost my suitcase!,2,,2025-01-03T01:29:47.000Z,"Flixbus lost my suitcase! | Flixbus lost my suitcase! The suitcase was removed in Kingston-an intermediary stop and was not returned to the hold! Just left there with another suitcase. How could the driver not be responsible enough to notice that 2 pieces were left back, possibly removed to allow another passenger to take theirs! This was not a case of suitcases looking alike- this was definitely due to the lack of vigilance on the part of the driver. The 2 suitcases were left on the side of the road where the bus stopped in Kingston. Obviously the fault of the Flixbus driver. Fortunately they were turned into the Kingston police!"

Flixbus Global,Not a great experience,1,,2024-12-31T14:48:47.000Z,"The bus pickup spot was in a dark parking lot in downtown Calgary with no lights, and dropped us off on the side of the road in Edmonton, despite saying it dropped off at the transit centre. The driver screamed at multiple passengers due to ticketing issues. The driver was getting honked at constantly due to poor driving, kept trying to overtake vehicles on the highway, and had very aggressive braking. There were a number of near-misses. Upon arrival, the driver simply opened the baggage compartment, and made customers crawl under the bus to get their things."
Flixbus Global,I have never had such terrible customer…,1,,2024-12-30T21:16:39.000Z,"I have never had such terrible customer service. About an hour after I left my luggage on board, I filled out the form online for lost baggage. I then called FlixBus to ask for help in getting the luggage back. I told the representative exactly what bus the luggage was on and the bus's route. It would have been easy to make sure the luggage was found and secured at the next bus station (and I could come get it). Instead, the representative refused to provide any information. He insisted that only the lost and found team could help me but that there was no phone number for this team and he had no ability to transfer me to them; in short, he said there was absolutely no way to contact the only people who could help. He also told me he could not connect me to the bus driver, who similarly could have made sure the luggage was secured at the next location or put on a bus back to where I got off the next day. That night, when the bus had finished its route and all the luggage was emptied from the bus, the company reported it had not found my bag, indicating that they either lost it, did not keep track of it, or that it got stolen because the issue was not attended to promptly. I called again and another representative repeated all the statements of the first representative. She also told me that there was no ability for me to speak to a supervisor or anyone but her. I was told repeatedly by both representatives that I have to wait 14 days, even though the luggage has important medicine and I will be leaving town in 2 days, such that if they find the baggage it will be even more difficult to retrieve. Again, this mistake could have been easily fixed."

FlixBus cancelled the bus with only 1 hours notice and booked her on a later bus requiring changes. As this was unacceptable then I cancelled the booking and requested a refund.

They installed I send a screenshot or a video of me calling them 15 mins before in order to honor the change. Smh long story short I ended up spending almost $100 to get home when the tickets were $33!! They are not willing to work with u and have no sympathy for they're customers.

Flixbus Global,"Horrible Experience, No Accountability",1,,2024-12-29T09:21:23.000Z,"My first experience with FlixBus in India was an absolute nightmare. On the night of December 24th, I booked a FlixBus from Delhi ISBT to Shimla, departing at 10:30 PM. I arrived at the boarding point at 10:00 PM and waited as per the host’s instructions, only to be left stranded late at night. Their communication was pathetic—unclear platform instructions and no effort to check if all passengers had boarded. As a solo female traveler, I felt unsafe and abandoned. | To make things worse, their customer service is dismissive and unhelpful. Instead of taking accountability, they hide behind policies and direct you to useless links that lead nowhere. Despite raising my concerns, they’ve refused to provide a refund or even acknowledge their failure. | From the number of negative reviews here and on their social media, it’s obvious FlixBus doesn’t prioritize customer safety or satisfaction. Avoid this service at all costs—it’s unreliable, stressful, and not worth the risk. Choose another provider if you value reliability and safety."
Flixbus Global,Very nice and comfortable trip,5,,2024-12-29T08:04:17.000Z,Very nice and comfortable trip. I arrived the bus station at the last second and the driver wait for me until I get in the bus.

Flixbus Global,The bus ride was the most convenient…,1,,2024-12-29T04:56:15.000Z,"The bus ride was the most convenient option with the amount of luggage we accumulated post Christmas and seemed to be the perfect occasion to ride our first ever bus as a family. The experience was horrible. The WiFi never worked, there was no power on the bus, and the bus driver allowed a passenger to scream and yell the entire trip, without interruption about the power outlets not working. My children were woken up many times on the bus and I left the bus with a migraine from all of the yelling. It was a very horrible first experience and guaranteed to be my last. We were testing the route to potentially travel to NC rather than by plane but it is clear that is not an option for our family and I will need to mail our bags home"
Flixbus Global,Complaint regarding my first experience with flixbus,1,,2024-12-29T01:32:57.000Z,"Subject: Complaint Regarding My First Experience with FlixBus |  | Dear FlixBus Customer Service, |  | I am writing to express my deep disappointment following my first experience traveling with FlixBus. I regret to say that the service fell far below my expectations, and I am compelled to share the details of my unpleasant journey. |  | Firstly, I found the driver’s attitude to be highly unprofessional. His demeanor towards passengers was harsh, unfriendly, and could even be described as threatening. He offered no assistance to passengers trying to load their luggage onto the bus, leaving many to struggle without support. |  | The situation worsened when the bus broke down, leaving us stranded for over four hours. The driver informed us that the bus could not start and, despite his repeated attempts to contact your office, he claimed there was no further support available. To my astonishment, he suggested that passengers make their own arrangements by taking taxis or trains to their destinations. This lack of contingency planning or care for stranded passengers is unacceptable and displays a shocking level of unprofessionalism. |  | After this extended delay, the driver abruptly announced that the bus was operational again. To add to the confusion and frustration, he accused passengers of tampering with the emergency alarm (or a similar mechanism), which he claimed was the reason for the initial breakdown. Such an accusation, combined with the earlier lack of support, left me feeling disrespected and further disillusioned with your company. |  | This entire experience was deeply frustrating, and I am genuinely disappointed by FlixBus’s failure to ensure passenger welfare or provide alternative solutions during the breakdown. I will not be using your services again and will strongly advise my friends and family against doing so as well. |  | I trust you will take this feedback seriously and address the issues raised to improve your service. |  | Sincerely, | Amaka"
Flixbus Global,Awful Unreliable,1,,2025-01-01T14:35:19.000Z,"Cancelled my trip at first, re booked for the next available trip and then they changed my journey time 2 hours before without my consent to an evening time which was 5 hours after my initial scheduled departure. There is no minimum guarantee whatsoever with them. Refund does not exist, they issue voucher's which again forces to use their service. Authorities should take legal action against them for illegally possessing customers money and not refunding them. | Update** for the reply from flixbus.. no excuses for multiple cancellations. This was a trip that we booked after the initial trip was cancelled and the newly booked trip was cancelled too.. I usually do not write negative reviews unless its an awful experience."

I ran to the bus stop to inform them that we were 3 minutes late, but the ticket man simply said, 'No, we don’t wait.' I asked if they could please wait, but they refused, telling me I would need to buy a new ticket. It's frustrating because when they’re late, we’re expected to wait, but they won’t show the same consideration for passengers."" | I understand that check ticket is his best goal of life, but if we can wait why can you not?! Very rude and unprofessional. It was the bus from Napoli to Bari at 2.30pm today. It I was the company I wouldn’t want someone so unprofessional to work for me. Get rid of that parasite"

You can quickly search locations, time tables, destination and make the necessary changes/cancellations when needed - fast and easy. | Prices are shown very visible according to the schedule, which helps a lot as with the duration and seats available! Nice work! |  | One thing I would definitely recommend, is having more flexible options with regards to flexible cancellations-changes so that you choose a more flexible way of touring. |  | Also, a suggestion: You need to create a page for your own account, so that you will be able to access your own trips - bookings. The same goes with the app. |  | Other than that, no issues so far. Since I am using flixbus often, I can change this review based on ym experience(s) of course."
Flixbus Global,"You can expect a consistent experience, smooth and safe",5,,2024-12-28T11:14:45.000Z,"I have taken Flixbus several times on both domestic and international trips, some of them three or four hours, other ones up to 20 hours. I feel they have reached a very high consistency in the product, so that you can always know what to expect when you get on one of their buses. The overall experience feels smooth and safe. Years ago, I wouldn’t have taken them, but now it’s an option just as valid as any other. Especially when the train is less convenient and when Flixbus offers a direct connection, it’s an option I am strongly considering. Of course, I am a sucker for the views from the first row on the higher floor of the double-decker masses. Those views are gorgeous, and I also take the extra space. You can sleep wonderfully on those seats."

Flixbus Global,Never travel with this company,1,,2024-12-28T04:39:14.000Z,Never travel with this company. When my wife was told to put her bag under the bus (same size as mine and I was allowed to board) she said she'd prefer not to as it contained valuables. She was told that if she didn't put the bag in she couldn't travel. When she went to comply the driver turned and said that as he was 'answering back' she was banned. I was asked if I was her husband (I hadn't spoken yet) and that I was banned too. He had also been shouting at a small boy that if he didn't produce a concession card he wouldn't travel - all as the boys mother searched for it. When I queried the 'ban' I was ignored and then threatened with the police and told I was banned from all filxbus services. Reported all of this to customer service with no detailed response.

We then rummaged through our suitcase, during which point the driver stood over us clapping and yelling abuse. After about a minute of searching the bus driver closed the luggage compartment and said he’s leaving without us. I asked if I could at least get my suitcase out. Thankfully at that point the passport was found but the driver again threatened to leave without us even though we had the passport. It’s intimidating and frightening being 2 girls and having two men stand over us and yell at us. The whole thing was awful. I also noticed that not a single other person was asked for their passport so it was clearly just because they saw two young ladies and their tiny pathetic shrimp d*** needed to bully and harass us.

But then when I checked my emails, it said I had bought a ticket and gave me the confirmation number but said I could cancel it. I canceled it within five minutes of the purchase. But the website gave me no option for cashback only a voucher to use on their bus. So I wrote their customer service thinking this was definitely a mistake and I sent them the screenshot and they still refused to change the situation and give me cash back because they said they had already issued a voucher. Which I had no choice in. So my advice would be not to use the website and book on another bus line."
Flixbus Global,Definitely recommend trying flixbus,4,,2024-12-24T04:22:31.000Z,"I have taken two trips so far and both experiences were really good.

Both drivers were nice&helpful. | The trip on the way back I took just now, was through quite brutal weather&the driver was amazing. He got us there just a bit shy of our original arrival time, in a snow storm&I was even able still able to connect with a city bus to get right home which I so appreciate. | The coach on the way back was super comfortable&a newer model. There was more leg room and a wider aisle&it was quite a smooth ride despite how nasty the slushy&snowy weather was. | My only issue is this 4minute limit for reserving a ticket on the website, and then refreshing with higher prices. This isn't long enough when you are having to simultaneously search for more details about connections with other transit systems, or for people who don't see well, or process differently. It's all around inconvenient and inaccessible. Editing/Changing your bookings means paying for yet another fair, which was still cheaper than the train. But it truly irked me the way they have this set up, they should call it ""flexbus""because the price is flexible. Still a decent price and an excellent rider experience, even with the opportunistic booking system I'll still give it a 4."

I had a trip at 1:40am from TIC to ORIENTE. I arrived at the station at 12:50am but this trip appeared nowhereon the screen. On the screen, it was showing 2:55am with the same bus number. I and another customer stayed there for some time. I then went to the waiting room but the other customer stayed at the parking. | I returned to the parking at 1:35am but no bus came. I found the other customer waiting there too. We waited until 3:30 but no bus came. The cleaner and security made a phone call and the person on the line pretended that the 1:40am bus left on time and the 2:55am bus left at 2:40am. The security guy said the at a call was made at the microphone for the 1:40am bus but this is not true as from the waiting room, we hear the message given on the microphone. No call was made for a bus that was not even appearing on the screen (schedule) | I was there at 1:35am guys! | The sad thing is the they lie to customers... we were only 2 customer going to Lisbon. I repeat the other customer didn't leave the parking and they just think they can trick us. I personally called the call center but no one picked. | *********** | Por favor, preste atenção, pois a FlixBus pode enganá-lo e decidem cancelar viagens fingindo que a viagem aconteceu. Eu tinha uma viagem à 1:40 da manhã, cheguei na estação às 12:50 da manhã, mas essa viagem não apareceu em lugar nenhum. Na tela, estava mostrando 2:55 da manhã. Eu e outro cliente ficamos lá por algum tempo. Então fui para a sala de espera, mas o outro cliente ficou no estacionamento. | Voltei para o estacionamento à 1:35 da manhã, mas nenhum ônibus veio. Encontrei o outro cliente esperando lá também. Esperamos até 3:30, mas nenhum ônibus veio. O faxineiro e o segurança fizeram uma ligação e a pessoa na linha fingiu que o ônibus da 1:40 da manhã saiu no horário e o ônibus das 2:55 da manhã saiu às 2:40 da manhã. | O triste é que eles mentem para os clientes... éramos apenas 2 clientes indo para Lisboa. Repito, o outro cliente não saiu do estacionamento e eles acham que podem nos enganar. Eu pessoalmente liguei para o call center, mas ninguém atendeu."
Flixbus Global,“Complaint Regarding Unprofessional and Aggressive Driver Conduct on Marseille-Porto FlixBus Trip,1,,2024-12-23T18:55:36.000Z,"I am writing to formally submit a complaint regarding my experience during the FlixBus trip from Marseille to Porto on [insert date]. |  | Throughout the journey, the drivers displayed extremely rude, impolite, and aggressive behavior towards the passengers, creating an uncomfortable and unprofessional atmosphere. There were several moments during the trip where the drivers were unpleasant and disrespectful to the passengers. Furthermore, a serious incident occurred at the stop in Vila Real around 5:00 AM. Two passengers exited the bus, but the drivers departed without waiting for them, leaving them stranded. Several passengers informed the drivers that two people were missing, but they responded dismissively, saying, “They left because they wanted to; I didn’t tell anyone to get off the bus.” |  | This attitude is unacceptable, especially at such an early hour, with no assistance provided to the affected passengers. I kindly request an investigation into this incident and would like to know what measures will be taken to prevent similar situations in the future. I also expect a response regarding the steps FlixBus will take to improve the quality of its service. |  | Thank you for your attention to this matter. I remain available to provide additional information if necessary."
Flixbus Global,Constantly cancelled!,1,,2024-12-23T18:25:21.000Z,"4 out of my last 5 journeys have been cancelled. 3 of the times minutes before the bus was due. The 4th was a few hours before. When trying to book on a ""free"" alternative the app mysteriously stopped working on 3 of the occasions. The 4th occasion a different bus was booked for me but it would get me in 2 hours later than expected and involved an hour's transfer in an unshelthered bus stop. Customer services do not care at all about the disruptions this causes. Do not book with this company as it is completely unreliable."

Flixbus Global,"To Romania in Flixbus , bad experience",1,,2024-12-23T16:43:26.000Z,"After waiting for two hours in Budapest Flixbus station , the route 1925 to Bucarest never arrived to pick me up. No one helped, at the office I was treated like I was a stupid child . I was blamed by the customer service (chat) of the company to be me the one responsable to miss the bus. The driver from route 1929 to bucarest din not helped, the woman from the desk was angry and so on. Never again"
Flixbus Global,terrible service,1,,2024-12-23T14:58:32.000Z,"I bought a comfortable seat, at a higher price to ensure comfort, but the reservation was changed on the day of the trip, it was not clear that the seat type had also been changed. I only found out at the time of boarding that, in addition to not having a sleeper seat, it also did not have a specific seat number. This could cause me to be bothered by other passengers who, eventually, had a specific number. In addition, I had to contact FlixBus support to find out which boarding platform would be because this was not clear on the ticket issued by the app."
Flixbus Global,Traveling with this company it's good but it can be improved,3,,2024-12-23T13:35:06.000Z,"Traveling with this company is generally a great experience. The seats are comfortable and the staff is friendly and open to adjusting the cabin temperature. |  | What unfortunately happened to me this time (and it's something that has happened on 3 of the 4 trips with the same company) was that they changed buses to another with a different seating configuration, which meant that my wife and I had to replace our seats . This, in addition to being a nuisance in itself, tends to create a sense of competition among passengers for seats, even if the paying passengers have received vouchers to compensate."
Flixbus Global,The worst of the transportation company…,1,,2024-12-23T11:52:28.000Z,"The worst of the transportation company I have ever use(.

I have written to support but they just say that can’t help, and I should endlessly wait …"
Flixbus Global,"Total disaster, be warned",1,,2025-03-06T09:12:49.000Z,"Update, March 6th. | Over two months later and despite encouraging words below, no-one from Flixbus has decided to get in touch to learn more about the diabolical conditions at their Brussels site. Very disappointed, but not entirely surprised. A company which cannot get the basics right probably isn't going to worry about extortion from drivers or unsafe conditions. So yesterday I called them up to see if this incident was recorded anywhere and it wasn't. So I have now made an official complaint and will see what comes of that. | ------ | This is for flixbus in Brussels central. Despite being forewarned (and prepared) by the large amount of negative reviews, I took a chance with the service. |  | It was still a total disaster, more than I could imagine. Dark, awful signage, deceptively useless app, no-one to speak English (only Russian in some cases), terrible lighting, filthy, broken shelters and at least one driver asking for money in exchange for advice. |  | Lots of unhappy and confused people, many of them cowering under the awning of a nearby office block to keep out of the freezing rain, or running between the various zones trying to find their bus. There were pickpockets and drug dealers hanging around, unimpeded. I was offered drugs twice in my time there. Were there no obvious staff to keep an eye on things, to keep passengers safe. |  | Despite waiting exactly in the place assigned I didn't see my bus. Having been nearly 3 hours in the rain and cold, I gave up and got an incredibly expensive train. So, 97 euros wasted. It's so bad and so incompetent I've never encountered such a terrible travel service in a developed country. And there's a handful of easy, obvious things which would make the whole experience significantly better. |  | If you're elderly, or unfamiliar with traveling this could end up being a genuinely terrifying experience."
Flixbus Global,On time but seats issues,1,,2024-12-23T09:02:48.000Z,"Bus came on time to pick us up. But immediately problems begum. | First thing is that there came apparently two buses with the same number and there was no way from their marking to tell which is your. Drivers came out, open trunks and said to pack baggage. | But the only way was to wait in long que to driver just to find out that this is the other bus. |  | Then when we went in it turned out that our ordered seats were occupied. There were some women who had ticket on places which apparently don't exist. And driver put them on our seats. | When we came they refused to get up. | Driver found places in back and asked two of our family to move there instead of asking those two women to move from our ordered places. | I asked that those two move not we but it did not work. | In the end some couple decided to help and got up and moved back so that our family could sit somewhat close to each other. | What is the point of reserving seats if this is not respected later?"

Flixbus Global,Awful experience,1,,2024-12-27T00:45:37.000Z,"Awful experience, bus delayed on a cold day before the holidays. Arriving bus driver constantly yells at customers who thought that the bus was the delayed arrival. Notification of cancellation of bus yet customer service refusing to provide a full refund. Avoid flixbus at all cost, not worth the cost or headache. in calling back in to customer service, the representative agreed to issue a full refund to resolve the matter."
Flixbus Global,Flixbus drivers chantage passengers for cash.,1,,2024-12-23T04:47:32.000Z,I travel from Amsterdam to Barcelona with a transfer in Paris with a hand bag and a bicycle with the two wheels unmounted and we'll packed with plastic film as they told me to do in Amsterdam. When I had to make the transfer in Paris the drivers ask me 50€ cash because of the bicycle. I asked for some document that proves that payment to home but he refused. Finally he agree to board my bicycle but I have to pay to his colegas that were going to change him in Orleans. The new drivers went to some gas station in the middle of nowhere and start shouting to me in front of everyone on board and threatening to me that if I don't withrow 20€ cash from the ATM and pay he was going to take out my bicycle. I asked again for some document that proves that payment but he refused. Finally I had to accept that chantage to not have my holidays ruined.
Flixbus Global,Missed bus at Pearson Terminal 1,1,,2024-12-23T04:29:34.000Z,"Missed bus at Pearson Terminal 1, Post 4 pick up location because I couldn't see the bus when it arrived at the terminal (and didn't stand outside in -16C cold weather at age 76) and bus driver did not step inside to announce the bus was outside and ready for boarding. Other bus company drivers came inside T1 Ground Level door to announce their departures to various cities; why can't Flix bus drivers extend that courtesy especially in inclement weather where there is no protection to stand outside at the designated bus stop."
Flixbus Global,A comfortable ride,4,,2024-12-23T03:26:29.000Z,"I appreciated being able to reserve seats, and the drive was comfortable. We took the bus from Munich to Neuschwanstein Castle. Based on the description of the journey, we thought we would be dropped off closer to the castle and didn’t realize we still needed to take a bus, a carriage, or a long walk to get to the top. The other bummer was that we booked the top level in the very front so we’d have great views on the drive- but the window was so fogged up the whole time, we couldn’t see much of anything. We’d wipe it down with a tissue and it would fog right back up."
Flixbus Global,Terrible lost luggage experience,1,,2024-12-23T03:09:25.000Z,"Someone else (or I) has swapped my luggage and I realized only when I have arrived at home. I have compiled the lost luggage questionnaire twice, one for my missing luggage and one for the fact that I have someone else’s luggage. They made me wait two weeks (holding me off from reporting my lost luggage to the police) for just sending me two exactly-identical pre-compiled emails telling me that they haven’t found it, not even caring that I had someone else’s luggage, that could have been taken to their offices and brought back to its owner. | It is clear the lack of any will to find out how to return the two luggage’s to their respective owners. I was a fan of FlixBus but after seeing their policies for the luggage reclaim I am very disappointed."
Flixbus Global,Breakdowns on Flixbus' trucks,3,,2024-12-23T01:51:06.000Z,"I like the FlixBus service, the buses are usually clean and the schedules are kept to. But this is the second time in a year that there have been breakdowns in the trucks."
Flixbus Global,Not good,1,,2024-12-25T17:00:37.000Z,"Driver texting, scrolling or talking on his phone constantly. The company have contacted me and are going to ensure that this doesn't happen again. Personally I do not wish to get the driver in serious trouble but perhaps it's possible to have some video system as a deterrent. Particularly among younger drivers who find it more difficult to leave their phones off. Thank you for responding."
Flixbus Global,"Very, very poor level of service",1,,2024-12-22T23:24:04.000Z,"The driver wouldn’t let me board the bus, even though I had a ticket reservation. | I was simply told that he was allowing no more passengers to get on the bus."

Flixbus Global,On my way from Wroclaw to Warsaw which…,1,,2025-01-18T03:31:59.000Z,"On my way from Wroclaw to Warsaw which took place yesterday, 21.12.24, around 9 p.m, my bus, route 1303, made a stop at the station in the town of Sieradz. The driver announced the stop for 5 minutes. I took my time to buy a water bottle in the nearest store, where I didn't spend more than 4-5 minutes. The bus drove off without waiting and checking for a missing passenger, leaving me alone in the town and my luggage on board. After several calls with disconnections, trying to reach an operator I was supposed to listen to a few minutes of unimportant information (in a hurry). The operator suggested, Flixbus could only help me get my suitcase back, not considering any refund or assistance with my further trip, though. | An hour later, after filling in the form on the webpage, I made several attempts for a phone call to the client service on the luggage issue, with the same procedure. Waited on the line for 15-20 minutes listening to music, only for the operator to tell me, I'll get the response in 14(!!) days time. |  | UPD! 18.01.25 3+ weeks later I'm informed, my belongings were not found. Also not delivered to the public found items office. My fault was not to bother locking my suitcase, where I kept about 200€ and I believe that's the reason the driver or whoever does the job of searching for lost items, decided to keep my luggage ""lost""."

Flixbus Global,"Absent Bus, Absent Staff, Avoid at All Costs",1,,2024-12-22T15:01:26.000Z,"Bus was scheduled to leave Inverness at 07:20. There was no information made available to passengers, no push notification or tracking in the app. No SMS or Emails were sent to inform passengers of the delay -until- TWO hours AFTER the expected departure time. |  | I have ended up paying more money on parking and a train and am extra out of pocket due to Flixbus' inability to run their service, without the courtesy to even answer their phones or respond to chats made within the opening hours advertised. |  | I was offered automatic refund, but to be honest would prefer compensation for the extra expense incurred to make my journey, unfortunately I doubt the existence of a customer service team as they could neither answer a phone or live chat. |  | Ironically they advertise the rights of passengers on their websites, which made it all the more jarring when they then breached these rights. |  | Avoid at all costs."
Flixbus Global,Rude driver,1,,2025-01-06T14:11:34.000Z,"driver scan out tickets, but didn't let us in said that we needed to pay extra for our luggage, he was very rude and I asked what can I do about and he just ignored us. we had no issues with the other 4 Flix busses, we had 2 luggages under 50 lbs and 2 standard carryon luggage, I had my laptop case and my wife had a small bagpack that she use as her purse. I want flixbus to refund my tickets that I had to buy again for the next bus 3219257934. As per the site. luggage policy we were within compliance and didn't need to buy extra bags. A very bad experience with the driver. |  | Your answer doesn't resolve my money lost due to driver not allowing us to board the bus. I want a full refund for this incident."
Flixbus Global,Unsafe Driving Experience,2,,2024-12-22T09:16:58.000Z,"The first part of the trip from Jyväskylä to Oulu felt very dangerous while driving. There were constant accelerations and braking, as well as risky overtaking of cars multiple times, even when there were oncoming vehicles. I heard other passengers around me say the same thing—that they felt very anxious and couldn't rest at all during the trip. When we arrived in Oulu, the driver must have changed because the journey felt much safer than before."
Flixbus Global,NOTHING stated the actual departure time,1,,2024-12-22T03:57:08.000Z,"My bus was late, no way to know when it will arrive at the station. | An hour of waiting, the bus arrives but still doesn't check people in, so everyone is still waiting. | While waiting an EVACUATION alarm started with alarm sounds and a clear demand of evacuating the building. So I left the station as per the alarm sirens and evacuation order. |  | Still no signs of when the bus is leaving and what should happen in this case. I called the phone number for Flixbus and the agent on the phone had no idea about anything that was happening. Said to call again in 10 mins. |  | Then i saw people going inside the station, so i went back inside, and apparently the bus left. I speak with the desk agent in the station, she said it was a false alarm and people boarded the bus and it left. And of course she had to be obnoxious. |  | So my question is, if the station issued an alarm. How is it my fault I left the building? ALSO, why did I receive 0 notification about the actual leaving time of the bus!? It was scheduled 7:30 and left 9:10. Even though i tried online tracking and tried to ask the desk agents and tried to read the info board, NOTHING stated the actual departure time. | So with all this failure of processes, Flixbus refuses to even give a refund. | The amount i paid is little but that's the minimum they can do after this horrendous night."

Flixbus Global,Flight 3270 (18:00) from Prague to Kyiv…,1,,2024-12-21T18:25:29.000Z,"Flight 3270 (19.12.2024; 18:00) from Prague to Kyiv (FlixBus) was delayed by 4 hours, and passengers were notified about this via email. As compensation, they were given water and a croissant. However, the water was expired (shelf life ended in 2023), and the croissant was a month past its expiration date! Many passengers had children, yet this still happened. |  | In Poland, the crew changed, and it turned into a nightmare. The new driver was rude and ill-mannered, constantly complaining. He forced passengers to take their bags into the bus cabin, even though they had paid for luggage space in the storage compartment. He also made a mother turn around her child’s car seat because its size made it difficult for him to pass between the rows, causing discomfort for both the mother and child. |  | As soon as we crossed the border into Ukraine, the restroom was locked and remained unavailable until we reached Kyiv. The driver refused to provide toilet paper, was rude to passengers, and prohibited throwing away trash inside the bus to avoid cleaning up later. |  | During the journey, the bus got a flat tire, resulting in an even longer delay in reaching the destination. Some seats couldn’t recline, making it impossible to rest, and there was no space for carry-on luggage. Even a coat barely fit. The advertised size for carry-on luggage was completely unrealistic, leaving passengers to keep their belongings at their feet, which was very uncomfortable on a 24-hour trip. |  | The overall impression of this trip was terrible. Unfortunately, the company’s staff severely tarnished the company’s reputation and completely discouraged any desire to use their services again in the future."

Flixbus Global,Feedback-complain,4,,2024-12-21T12:20:05.000Z,"I would like to share my experience regarding a recent trip to Germany. Unfortunately, instead of the comfortable journey I was expecting, I faced numerous issues and disappointments. |  | Firstly, the onboard restroom was out of order during the trip to Poland. Later, in Germany, when it supposedly became available, there was no water at all. This caused significant discomfort for all passengers, especially during long stretches of the journey. |  | Secondly, the drivers were completely impolite and indifferent. They didn’t even bother to help passengers load heavy luggage into the baggage compartment, which is part of their duties! |  | Adding to this, the promised Wi-Fi in Germany didn’t work for a single minute. This was crucial for many passengers, especially those planning further connections or working on the go. |  | But the most frustrating aspect was the disregard for the timing of stops. The drivers ignored the schedule, leaving passengers to wait and waste their time and patience. |  | My trip was filled with stress and disappointment. I urge you to take appropriate measures to improve the service and make it truly comfortable for passengers. We pay for quality and expect to receive it! |  | I hope for your response and compensation for such an unacceptable journey."

Travel from Prague to Vienna : 1 hour and 30 min delay. I pay extra for panoramic seats but the bus didn’t have something like that. I don’t know why they charge for something like this. The both drivers take at least 4-5 break to smoke that’s is unacceptable. Normal we should arrive at 19:00 but because of the delay and smoke break we arrive at 21:20. They didn’t help us with the luggage. It was a chaos because there was some girls who could not pick up their luggage but both drivers just sat and watched and smoked how that ladies try to put their luggage. Overall I will never use Flixbus ever!

I am 83, have cancer, need a cane. So I sat in my son's car at the Southgate Transit Centre where my ticket said. When I saw it across the street, and other people running across the road to get it, my son drove me to the back of the bus. The snow was too deep for me.

There was no clean air to breathe, the whole bus smells shitty (mixed of sweat, food, socks, smoke etc.).

Flixbus Global,Departure time,3,,2024-12-19T23:16:09.000Z,Our bus journey stsrted from Lansisatama T2. Departure time on ticket was 22:30. No mention about ferry or where to go just pointer on the map. Lucky that we were 45min early and started asking around. Turned out that first leg of our journey was handled by Tallink. Gate closed like 22:00. And we were already sailing 22:15. Not all customers were so lucky though. We were told that last ferry went as someone was waiting outside at the marker bus to come.

I left my luggage in the lower compartment of the bus and then the guy handling the luggage (from FLIX) suspiciously put my luggage aside and asked me if I was travelling alone, then my luggage was in another place when I arrived to my destination. Be careful with this company. I went online and there is plenty of comments of stolen goods and lost luggages issues that are unsolved by the company. You might think it is cheap but it could be costly at the end!"

Flixbus Global,Safety concerns,1,,2024-12-19T11:55:49.000Z,"Our first trip from Paris to Champagne was good except the bus was running 15 minutes late and the communication about this was terrible. You have an app show some respect, send everyone a message instead of having everyone standing around in the cold at 7.30am wondering what is happening. Our return trip was a very different scenario. When we got onto the bus we had two people sitting in our seats. When I kindly asked them to move the big guy responds 'no' to which I say 'sorry, we paid for these seats' , I show him the tickets and ask him again to vacate the seats. He tells me to go find somewhere else to sit, again I say no we paid for these seats. The bus is full and the engine starts up... Eventually after I had.to become forceful in my tone, he gets up but gets into my face threatening me. Of course no one else says anything or interjects ....Needless to say I spent the journey back to Paris concerned for both the safety of my daughter and I, including when we got off the bus. This system of deconstructing payments where it is not across the board does not work and ends up in this jungle mentality. This shouldn't occur, people should feel safe and the drivers should do a check on the upper floor before driving away. Aside from that there was also an issue with the window seal so the bus upstairs, especially us got to enjoy the whole was back to Paris this high pitched shrill whistling of air. Not sure if I will do this bus again."

Flixbus Global,CAN SOMEONE HELP PLEASE ???,1,,2024-12-19T09:25:58.000Z,"CAN SOMEONE HELP PLEASE ??? |  | On December 12 at 9 PM, my friend Isabelle Van Malder ‘s daughter traveled from NYC to Toronto via FlixBus, bringing four pieces of luggage stored in the bus’s cargo bin. Upon arrival, one of their suitcases was missing. The suitcase, along with its contents—including all new clothing purchased before the trip—was valued at approximately $1,500. More importantly, it contained school books and handwritten class notes, which are irreplaceable and vital. |  | Despite multiple attempts to contact FlixBus customer service, which appears to be based in India, no resolution has been reached. Upon arriving in Toronto, they reported the incident to the local police, who unfortunately stated they had other priorities. They also approached the bus terminal staff to review video footage, but the suitcase was not visible in the recordings. Strangely, the bus stops where the driver made brief stops had no cameras. During one of these stops, two individuals—seemingly friends or colleagues of the driver—boarded the bus, though no passengers disembarked. (At least according to what the driver said, was that true? It's hard to recall when those stops were both happening between 5 and 6 AM ). |  | At this point, they are unsure how to proceed, and neither am I. If you have any advice on resolving this matter or know of a lawyer who could assist, please let us know. Thank you!"

He did not help anyone with their bags, he talked loudly for the entire bus ride to destination, he was over 40 minutes late after the time he said he would pick us up after the rest top, he refused to turn on the internet on the bus, he was rude to multiple passengers, there were no assigned seats in spite of being charged for assigned seats, he did not check your bags so it was a total waste of money to pay for extra bags. do not waste your money with this service.

Flixbus Global,7 hour ride in a small bus while driver is smoking the entire ride,1,,2024-12-17T16:51:10.000Z,"Booking via Flixbus makes you think the ride takes up between 4hours- 50 minutes or 5 hours -50 minutes. In reality, as soon as you reach the Nort Macedonian border after a 4 hour drive, you realize the rest of the ride will still take another 3 hours at least, which makes the travel a total of 7 hours at least. It would be honest to all travellers to mention the realistic travel time as well as to which vehicle will be used to travel. In reality a 20 person bus takes you from Tirana East Gate Terminal to Skopje, there is no way you can reserve a seat, nor would you have the luxury to pay for a suitable seat during a 7 hour ride. | Anyone travelling and needing to transfer to a flight on time will be disappointed, so needs to be aware."

There’s no regular designated point or pick up and drop off location. I boarded the from Houston to Dallas on 12/14/24 at 1:30pm to 6pm. I was dropped off at Market center to be precise Market Dinner and was told to join the bus at the same location for my return to Houston. On getting to board back Houston on Monday 12/16 at 1:33pm same location where I was dropped off, after waiting at the pick up location and scheduled time I decided to call the customer service who confirmed the departure of the bus. I was so devastated and quickly left for the next bus stop to catch up with the bus, but unfortunately I still missed the bus. I purchased another ticket and went gray to make an enquires on the but pick up and drop off schedule locations and thereafter headed back to Market Center. All these stressed me out and even after calling the customer service for refund they declined and cut the line off. I will never wish my enemies to go with flixbus. I do not recommend them."

Had to take another bus. |  | PS: Note the answer the company gave below. Absolutely astonishing. On the bus from another company I had to use, four other people were aboard that were also stranded by Flixbus. One of them, a French girl, actually got a refund. Me and another man did not. So the ""accordance"" they talk about is a blatant lie."
Flixbus Global,The worst experience,1,,2024-12-12T17:23:54.000Z,"I’m very disappointed with FlixBus’s handling of my recent trip from Washington, DC, to Boston via New York. The trip was delayed, poorly managed, and ended up costing me extra money and unnecessary stress. |  | The first leg of the trip was nearly an hour late, causing us to miss our connection to Boston. Customer service told me the bus’s GPS was “turned off” and advised me to “be patient.” When the bus finally arrived in New York at 8:15 PM—well after our 7:30 PM connection had left—there were no other buses to Boston that day. We had to rent a car to complete the trip. |  | Our ticket included the transfer, so the missed connection was FlixBus’s responsibility. Customer service even said expenses would be covered if the delay was their fault. However, when I requested a refund for the second leg, FlixBus denied it, claiming their system didn’t show any delay. This is outrageous—if they don’t record delays, does that mean they never have to take responsibility? |  | This experience was frustrating and unprofessional. FlixBus needs to take better care of their customers. Until they do, I won’t recommend them to anyone."

She treated us like we were all going to jail for crimes. She pulled her bus over mid ride saying she smelled weed, she made each passenger get off and sniffed us like she was a police dog, she falsely accused an elder lady of having weed and left her there with her things with no where to go, the young woman who actually had the weed did not get kicked off the bus. She made me leave my carry on next to her , when I asked can I get Tylenol from my bag because I had suffered car wreck injuries and was in pain, she told me no I could not go into my bag, so I suffered pain the entire ride, I was hungry and thirsty and wasn’t allowed to get my snacks from the bag. The lady drive wreckless , speeding the entire time, I kept jumping out my sleep because the bus kept swerving and blowing people off the road with her horn, she had a very loud conversation during the entire ride with her assistant. At the end of the trip she screamed at everyone to exit the bus, some passengers Was still sitting because they were waiting on everyone to exit so they can exit , she screamed at them and said they needed to get up and leave now . She was absolutely HORRIBLE, the bus ride was a worst nightmare. Never thought I spend money on a ride to be handled like a criminal.

What I don´t understand is why Flixbus sells these tickets for the highest price when they know really well that person won´t be able to sit in their seat they paid for. Other passenger called their customer care line and he was told that tough luck. Disgusting. I see, they´re selling these seats on other long distance buses, so it was not some bug in the system.

Most seats seemed to have stains but the bus was clean and trash was empty when we got on the bus. Guess smoking while working around others who may not smoke is not a huge concern for some. Bathroom worked. Basically, it was cheap and safe travel. Nothing more or less. If I had to pay more, I would have been upset but for 30 euros, I got what I paid for.

Flixbus Global,Complaint Regarding Theft During Trip from Brussels,1,,2024-12-09T01:12:13.000Z,"I am writing to express my disappointment regarding an incident that occurred during my recent trip with FlixBus. On the journey from Brussels, at the first pause point before Luxembourg (a gas station), we discovered that our backpack, which was stored in the overhead luggage area, had been stolen while we were taking a rest on the bus. |  | Unfortunately, the gas station had no cameras to assist in identifying the thief. Additionally, the driver mentioned that thefts like this have happened multiple times on this specific route. Despite this, no warnings were given to passengers about the risk, nor did the driver offer to contact the police when we reported the issue. I believe these measures could have easily helped prevent such incidents or at least mitigated the impact on passengers. |  | I am extremely dissatisfied with the lack of proactive measures and response from your staff in this situation. I urge FlixBus to take this matter seriously and implement actions to ensure such incidents do not happen again—whether by educating passengers, improving staff protocols, or enhancing security measures. |  | Lastly, I sincerely hope the thief faces the consequences of their actions, as this experience has been deeply upsetting."

Flixbus Global,Inhuman attitude of flix bus employees,1,,2024-12-07T05:42:35.000Z,"I booked a ticket for my entire family on December 6 2024 from Edmonton Southgate station to Calgary at 5.35pm. I have a flight to catch at 03.00 am to Kochi, India on December 7, 2024. We arrived at Southgate at 5pm.We waited till 5.40pm.No bus. We thought bus may be delayed. Then a lady come to us and told that there is a small board on nearby bus post mentioning that bus stop is changed from December 1. I went there and saw a small board which is very vague about the new bus stop. Around 12 to 15 people were still there waiting for the bus. No one is aware about the new bus stop. I had tried before to get a contact no for flix bus. I never found one before. Same now also. One person gave a contact number. It seems to be a USA number. I called the number, gave the booking number and other details and explained the seriousness of the situation. The call centre executive disconnected the phone. I called many times. Same thing happened at least 5 times. Standing out in the severe cold outside with my 84 year old mother, I tried desperately for 20 minutes. But the same thing happened again. At last a person took the call and told me that the bus is already gone. I asked her whether she can contact the driver and she told me she cannot. I told the seriousness of the situation, but to no avail. Now I have called a local person who drives his car as taxi and I am paying $ 850 for a trip to Calgary. All this happened when the new bus stop was on the opposite side of the road with a metro train station in between. The driver could surely see the crowd standing here waiting for the bus, but did not have the courtesy to bring the bus here and at least inform that the bus stop is moved to the new location. I received no email regarding any change of bus stop. Can you imagine the situation where sb took so much pain and around $12500 to book a flight to India and come to know that the transport to the airport is gone in the harsh winter. How dejected can one feel. They may have declared the stop change in the website, but does not even have the courtesy to inform the passenger through an email. Nor any stop change is mentioned in the bus ticket. They are not even ready to give a refund. Can someone suggest me whether I can sue Flixbus for the financial and mental distress they have caused. Kindly provide any suggestions to nibuabraham2024@ gmail.com"

Flixbus Global,Driver fell asleep!!,1,,2024-12-07T00:11:21.000Z,"Your driver was falling asleep at the wheel on the Las Vegas to Barstow leg of the trip from Las Vegas to Los Angeles! She couldn't maintain lane control and was constantly hitting the lane dividers for the first hour of the trip. She finally went over the rumble strips on the right side of the road and jerked the bus back into the lane, at which point the Remedial Trainer/Supervisor that was monitoring her told her to pull over at the next exit and took over the drive. The original driver promptly fell asleep as the replacement drove perfectly the rest of the way into Los Angeles. |  | On the return trip from Downey to Las Vegas there were no markings or signs to indicate where the busstop was. The map on the email and website showed where the bus was going to embark, and that location was confirmed by the info desk of the mall and two gentlemen who walk around that mall for exercise. However, when the bus came, it parked in a completely different part of the mall and myself and 2 others who were waiting at the supposed spot would have missed the bus if a kind woman who was dropping off her grandson hadn't drove by and told us where the bus actually was. Almost missed the bus because of the incompetence and negligence of Flixbus! |  | When we got to Barstow on the return trip, we were told that they would switch drivers, and of course it was the same lady who'd almost fell asleep and driven us off the road! This was 12 days after that initial trip, which is quite enough time to dismiss a driver who's fallen asleep at the wheel. She was awake this time, but it was a scary trip because she can't keep the bus in the lane or centered in the lane. And every time she came to a curve she was swerving out of the lane, sharply braking for no reason, and if there were trucks on that curve that she was passing she'd swerve completely out of the lane and it felt like she was trying to run the bus off the road. It was a nightmare trip and I exited the bus before my stop because I was just happy she hadn't killed us. The extra cost for a longer Uber ride home was worth getting off that bus."

Flixbus Global,Cheap and reliable transport,4,,2024-12-06T06:01:07.000Z,The bus reached the pick up point on time. The driver and other staff were nice ....I reached my destination also on time.
Flixbus Global,No such thing as a paid seat without a fight,3,,2024-12-06T05:43:34.000Z,I have repeatedly had to advocate for my parents to be put in their paid assigned seats. The drivers always say that people can sit anywhere and there’s no assigned seats. This trip the bus driver argued that the front rows are not safe for passengers even though they are the panorama seats that cost extra. He said they shouldn’t be for sale. My parents have disabilities and need to sit in front so I always pay extra but always have to argue with the driver to make sure they get their seats.

I wish he would've called us as we were looking for the bus just across the street. The email and cellphone info were collected when I booked online, why didn't the driver use those to contact us when he noticed were not yet on board , I even added an extra luggage online 1 hour before the trip..I am so disappointed..I paid 150 for Rider bus + 250 for red arrow for us to arrive in fort macleod as originally planned.. if there's an important change don't put the announcement in the bottom right part of the online ticket and with very small letters"
Flixbus Global,"Cheap, easy and comfortable",5,,2024-12-06T00:07:47.000Z,"The application is very intuitive, the prices are affordable, and the stations are conveniently located. The drivers are friendly and helpful. You can buy snacks on board and access the toilets if needed. I travel with FlixBus multiple times a month and strongly recommend the company. Just be aware that traffic is not factored into the travel time on your itinerary, so plan ahead if you’re booking a trip around 5 PM on a weekday."

Check in times for flights wastes time and train travel is twice as expensive and only marginally better in relation to time saved. My wife and I are from Sydney and plan to use flexibus for multiple route's- this way we plan to go to multiple countries with our two children

Flixbus Global,I had a race from Brussels to Amsterdam…,1,,2024-12-05T19:18:31.000Z,"I had a race from Brussels to Amsterdam at 08:25 and although I arrived almost an hour earlier in Brussels North Station, I did not make it to platform C in time where my bus was leaving and I lost this race. (I mention that I asked a Fluxbus driver going to Germany about platform C and he gave me completely wrong directions - because of which I lost the ride) After this, the next bus to Amsterdam came at 09:00, which did not recognize my ticket taken for a previous ride (which of course I had not taken), but instead wanted to take 35 eur/person in cash (with all because I already had a ticket). Of course, I bought another online ticket for the 10:30 a.m. ride for 16.5 euros/person and arrived at my destination."
Flixbus Global,Feeling Safe,5,,2024-12-05T18:40:29.000Z,"Once I found the offsite location of the Greyhound/Flixbus station. I felt secure. The station was clean in appearance. The restroom was neat and clean smelling and fully supplied. There were device charging station's, vending machine’s and lots of seating as well as chair plugs. The employees were professional, organized and very knowledgeable."
Flixbus Global,Nice trip,4,,2024-12-05T18:07:28.000Z,"Took the bus from Budapest to Bratislava. | Positives: We were surprised how comfortable and clean it was. The journey was smooth and punctual and was very cheap in comparison to the train. There was wifi on the bus, and because everyone had an allocated seat number, there was no mad scramble for seats. | Negatives: the departure station from Budapest was out in the suburbs of Buda and required a twenty minute tram ride to get there. Clearly it would be better if Flix could leave from a more central station. | Would definitely use Flixbus again."

Flixbus Global,"Decent trip, but the company's drivers need to watch their behaviour.",3,,2024-12-05T14:59:59.000Z,"I had booked a one-day round trip with FlixBus from Vienna to Bratislava on 3rd of December 2024. The initial bus trip to Bratislava was generally decent and punctual with a drawback: I did not appreciate the fact that the driver went down on a stop to smoke. Unprofessional thing to do while you are on the job. Could have waited to do that when the itinerary was over. The return trip though is a different story. That one not only was delayed but the driver was rude to us when we were trying to check in to the bus. While we were trying to find the correct one, we encountered many of the company's drivers, and all of which beared an utterly unprofessional manner, speaking little English, not being helpful at all. Since most of their customers are international travellers and commute workers, English should be a prerequisite for their personnel."
Flixbus Global,the driver checked properly,3,,2024-12-05T11:20:18.000Z,"the driver checked properly, trip was run smoothly. the seat was selected and paid for it but end up someone else seat on it what waste of money"

Flixbus Global,"DON'T: expensive,incorrect information",1,,2024-12-10T08:17:27.000Z,Ticket leaving the new bus station in New Belgrade: I missed the bus. The wrong platform number was given. None of the employees at the bus station knew where the bus was or even where the listed platform was. The least you could do was at least do enough research to list a valid platform. The price was double that of tickets bought directly at the station.

I don’t believe smoking is even allowed to begin with on these buses. Worst experience on a bus ever and we are seasoned travellers. Do not use Flix Bus if you do not like a Smokey environment!
Flixbus Global,worst travel ever,1,,2024-12-04T20:47:38.000Z,"delayed departure, not really good communication, the driver took a half hour break in the middle of nowhere. the arrive was three hours later then what was supposed to be."

Instead, drivers leaved passengers near some random bus station in the city. It was cold (4th of December), my family expected to meet me at the planned station.

Flixbus Global,Odorous refund policy,1,,2024-12-04T13:55:42.000Z,"Train cancellations due to storm Bert prompted my wife and I to seek other options to get us home from London to Cardiff. In some despair we booked an expensive [£90.00] Flixbus at 07:05 on 25 November to travel at mid-day. On reflection we discovered a better option and cancelled the Flixbus booking at 09:33, well ahead of our departure time. Fully accepting that we had messed Flixbus around, we did not expect a full refund, however, we were disappointed to receive a mere voucher for future travel at a paltry 32% of our original payment. Adding insult to injury we requested a cash alternative. This was rejected outright by way of a weasel worded e-mail, clearly drawing upon their plethora of legal small print justifying their action. Whilst this was so prevalent in Covid times, we innocently thought such tactics had been suppressed. | We have learned an expensive lesson and clearly will never use this company again, but a warning to others to be aware of this company’s refund practices."

I purchased our tickets in September. I tried contacting Flixbus via their ""live"" chat and still haven't received a reply 10 hours later. We then had to purchase NEW tickets to get on the next bus.

Flixbus Global,Avoid - Company Leaves You Stranded And Then Try To Make You Buy Further Tickets,1,,2024-11-27T19:06:40.000Z,"Ref MMiyv31bfD-ag5JAO9njeSA |  | Wow, what can I say about Flixbus. |  | My outbound journey from Newcastle- Leeds on 22nd November was great, worked like clockwork probably due to the fact journey was subcontracted out to Chalfont of Northampton. | Coaches are more modern and better quality, also went on time. |  | However my return journey was a nightmare, I arrived at Leeds Bus station at 10:35 for my 11:00 coach in plenty of time. | I stayed until approx 11:50 due to appalling customer service I heard from FlixBus to a fellow passenger. | They advised tickets could not be transferred onto 12:20 service and further tickets must be re bought, I did not accept this, if 11:00 AM didn't turn up same again could happen on next service, I then chose to get the train. | Also no tracking was available for this journey as this was also subcontracted - Flix bus have dodged this question twice now. |  | What really annoyed me in email communication is them stating I missed my coach. This infuriated me as I arrived 25 mins early, I screen shotted my Uber ride to bus station as proof with drop off time included. |  | Flixbus then continue to state coach did leave, no time was given, I was stranded with approx 8 other passengers but I'm in the wrong? |  | Questions I have for you flixbus as you keep dodging questions on email. |  | 1. Why was no tacking available for me and any other passenger, is my assumption correct in saying when you subcontract the work out tracking is not available - can always check with Chalfont or even Berry Coaches as you also use. |  | 2.I have provided proof I was on time, why should I pay for further bus tickets - same could happen of next journey. | Out of courtesy I would be greatful.if you could refund my train ticket. |  | Really wish I did not have to resort to a negative review, this could have been avoided if your agents were given better customer service training. |  | I look forward to a hopefully none generic response."

Flixbus Global,Horrible Experience - do not recommend,1,,2024-11-26T22:11:25.000Z,"I am only giving this one star because the bus arrived on time. |  | I’ll start with the driver. As soon as we boarded the bus we were informed that she was instructed by FlixBus not to turn on the heat to conserve gas. My family and I were freezing the entire ride. There were cracks in the windows so it was felt colder on the bus than outside. This is unacceptable. To make matters worse we were also told the bathroom had no toilet paper. Please keep in mind this was a five hour drive from Las Vegas to Downtown Los Angeles. Again, unacceptable. The driver did stop in Barstow for us to grab food and use the restrooms. This stop delayed our trip and caused us to arrive late to Downtown LA causing us to lose ticket reservations to a tour we previously booked. I am grateful Crypto arena was able to accommodate us for a later time. We also weren’t allowed to have music or watch television on the ride down. The driver also wore headphones the entire time and was not alert. We had to walk up and tap her to get her attention. All in all this was an awful experience. To make matters worse while on the ride down our return trip was cancelled and we had to rebook. We were able to rebook for free but this was yet another inconvenience. |  | The return trip was also awful. We were able to rebook for free on the FlixBus app for a greyhound. The greyhound was not wheee it was supposed to be or properly numbered as stated in the Flix bus app. This caused us to board late and possibly get left behind had we not communicated with driver to make sure it was our bus. Overall awful experience with FlixBus and I will not be using them again. Do not use them!"

Then, on November 26, I received a second notification informing me that my booking had been cancelled for an unexplained reason, and that I would be refunded. However, the message did not specify when I could expect the refund.

Flixbus Global,STOLEN LUGGAGE AND NO ONE CARES!!!!!,1,,2024-11-26T09:21:07.000Z,"I get on the bus in DC At 6:30 PM. The Driver announces that we’re not making any stops we’re going directly to Newark and then to midtown! When I make it to my destination, which is midtown Manhattan. I go to retrieve my suitcase off the bus and it’s gone. There’s no suitcase no nothing! I’ll tell the bus driver Alvin Of the situation and his first response was to laugh in my face. I’m sure you can imagine that pissed me off because I told him several times I don’t see what’s funny. Everything I have is missing. He then states that he’s just a driver all he does is drive. He doesn’t touch bags. I said no problem but you just let anybody get off the bus and take whatever they want!! The police were called they never showed up!! Call them back on my way home to let them know that I had to go because my last train is leaving and I don’t live in the city! Another thing the bus driver told me was he doesn’t work for FlixBus so they contract out other companies I guess and they drive the bus for them! What I learned today is when things go wrong. They just passed the blame from adventure tours to FlixBus and Nothing gets resolved!! Total transparency, the only one that kind of helped the situation-not really, Because he was getting nasty as well I guess I was holding his bus up waiting for the police to arrive! When I try to explain to him some of the was missing and why I was so livid Because no one seems to care because it’s not theirs! He may not work directly for FlixBus, but you’re associated with them so you’re guilty by association. I then said for example. If we enter a bank together and I pass the teller a note, you’d still be guilty by association if I was there to rob them and we entered the bank with me. He then states he makes way too much money to ever rob a bank and then I reiterated I work way too f*c*ing hard for the things in my suitcase for Everyone to act as if it didn’t matter!! if nobody was going to replace my stuff out of pocket right away, then we should care some more and find out who took it!!"

They informed us about a delay, but it ended up being shorter than stated, and the bus left without us. No warnings, no chance to catch our ride! And that’s not all. There’s no emergency contact number — only a useless chat where you’ll be bounced around with generic responses while you’re stuck outside with no solution. |  | This is not a transport company; it’s a joke!

Flixbus Global,Appalling service,1,,2024-11-25T12:47:35.000Z,Booked a bus in advance to take us from Berlin Airport to dresden. Thw information supplied on the ticket had no bus stance number and only said it was at terminal 1/2. We ended up missing our bus and were offered a 9 euro refund after having to pay them 15 euros cancel fee. I called to ask where the bus stop actually is as it clearly wasn't any if the 20 plus bus stops outside the airport. The operator said he didn't understand and then hung up on me. First and last experience with flix. It turned out the bus pickup was 4 streets away at a bus station not actually in the airport as the ticket suggests. Poor level of information supplied and poor customer service. In the end when we had made the bus the seats we had been charged for were occupied and we had to sit separately

Flixbus Global,Seats had someone's body fluids all over it and bus driver had us load the busses and sit in it without informing us,1,,2024-11-25T16:52:43.000Z,"I rode a 2 hour bus ride with my 9 year old daughter. When the bus got to our stop to pick us up, they had some kind of medical emergency with another passenger and medics had to come get the customer. I didn't know what what going on or what the emergency was because we were outside the entire time. After the other customer was taken away, the driver said that we could load the bus and that she'd be back because she had to pee. We all loaded the bus and sat in our assigned seats that I pre paid for. When she got back she then asked where that previous customer was sitting and other passengers said that he was sitting in our seat. She came over to us and said that we might want to move because he had gotten body y fluids all over our seats. I was so disgusting and upset that she had us load the bus and find our seats after knowing that someone had body fluids everywhere on our seat. After scrambling to find other seats, I waited till we got to our destination before I confronted the driver about how upset that I was that she let us load the bus and find our seats knowing that someone's body fluids were everywhere. She wasn't apologetic at all and was very rude. She called me insane and a terrible parent for being upset with her in front of my daughter. I have it all recorded on my phone and plan on having this investigated further. Will never ride that bus again. Terrible first experience"

Flixbus Global,Misguided by Staff and Rude Customer Service,1,,2024-11-23T17:20:38.000Z,"This company doesn't take responsibility for its staff and has very rude customer service. |  | I booked a bus from NYC to Philly and arrived at the bus station on time. Bus 2602 was supposed to go to Philly, but I didn’t see any bus with this number there. I asked the Flixbus staff (who were there all the time watching buses coming and leaving) which bus I should get on to Philly, and I was told that none of them was going to Philly, and the bus was delayed. I waited for 1 hour, called customer service, and was told the bus actually left on time. Given that it was late, I had no choice but to book an expensive train ticket instead. I later tried chatting with customer service online, saying it was their responsibility to compensate customers for their misleading staff. Throughout the chat, I was being polite. However, the agent simply ended our chat before I could finish. |  | Yes, I know the refund policies clearly. However, the point here is that customers should be able to trust Flixbus's staff. It doesn't matter how many passengers got on the bus, as a passenger shouldn't need to ask other passengers for the correct departure information in the first place. The staff should be able to provide the most accurate information. If they fail to do so, Flixbus is totally responsible for their mistakes. However, Flixbus customer service not only tried to put this responsibility on me (by repeating ""most passengers got on the bus"") but also cut me off rudely when I was making my request. This is enough to show that Flixbus doesn't value its customers. |  | Very angry. For anyone thinking about booking please be aware of the risk. |  | — 23 Nov Update — | I tried contacting Flixbus on Instagram, and yielding no results. Again they tried to pin this on me saying “note that passengers are responsible for checking the correct line for boarding”, and gave me generic answers, regardless that in my situation I was clearly taking my part of the responsibility as a passenger. I had arrived early, checked departure location and bus number, then asked staff for help. |  | Now it is clear that a Flixbus staff member can straight up providing completely incorrect answers to your questions, potentially making you miss you a bus and causing other inconveniences. And this will still be your responsibility. You will still have to bare all financial losses according to Flixbus policies. |  | So again, please be aware of the risk when booking with Flixbus."

Flixbus Global,The most Bizarre Customer service!,1,,2024-11-22T21:59:01.000Z,"My mother needed a bus ticket as she doesn’t like to drive long distances and her destination wasn’t far enough to fly (3 hour drive) she wanted a bus that would stop near by her home and didn’t want to travel downtown. 15 hours ago I booked a ticket on Flix Bus. I had never heard of this company in my life but they have a stop 15 minutes from her home. So I booked it and I accidentally booked it a week off (wrong dates). When I woke up this morning I realized the dates were off and attempted to change and then cancel the ticket but the website automatically charges a fee equal to 50 percent of the fare paid. I figure I would contact them and have it changed as it is a genuine mistake. I initially contacted them on the website as that seemed like the only option and I was informed in more than one way that a change without the fee was not possible. I then tried contacting them on Facebook and I was told the same thing. I then found a customer service number and called only to be told the same exact thing but in a crazy turn of events, I was then told by the “customer service agent” that he couldn’t help me and he hung up on me and when I tried calling again in order speak to a supervisor I was hung up on twice. They won’t even speak to me at this point. At no point was I rude or belligerent. This is my first experience with this company and obviously my last. Is this the normal level of customer service for Flix or am I missing something here? This is the most bizarre experience I have ever had with a company."

While filling up the form the bus driver called me from my girlfriend‘s phone (which i was trying to call it the whole time) and told me that he has the phone, but he can’t give it to me because he is already on another trip. So i asked him to hand it to Berlin central bus station and i will come back and grab it through the next week. | The problem that i live 350 km away from Berlin and i have a FULL TIME JOB which not so easy to go anytime there. The next day someone from Berlin bus station reception calls me and tells me WE HAVE THE PHONE if you want to come by and grab it and i told the guy that i will do my best to come as soon as possible ! | After 4 days when i got a chance through the week i drove from Kiel to Berlin (5 hours) to grab the phone and surprise!! The phone was already transferred to the ”lost and founds“ and they told me they will reply to you in 3 WEEKS from the day you filled up the form. It‘s been now almost a month, my girlfriend literally has no access not to bank account or anything else, and no response from the lost and founds no contact information, NOTHING!!! And everytime i try to check the status of the lost item the wonderful message pops up saying: “sorry we couldn’t find you item yet“, i tried to email the customer service and their response was ”this is the lost and founds team responsibility“ | I tried to fill up another form, also nothing. | I don’t know if the phone is just simply lost or gone or maybe stolen even though it was handed to the reception ! |  | So be careful losing any item with them because it will gone in a black hole, or maybe black market :)"

Both changes were, to be fair, clear enough text descriptions of the timetable change looking back when viewed in isolation. |  | However, in neither case did they provide a new boarding pass meaning my Google wallet and calendar continued to stay out of sync. |  | Even though they had my cellphone number I never received any updates through that channel (I have data her thankfully but this isn't always the case) |  | A few days before our trip I opened the confirmation email to click on the tracking link to double check the departure time and location. No up to date information was shown and instead the page just reported that live tracking was unavailable. Another perfect opportunity to present an up to date summary of the booking that was missed. |  | Standing at the bus stop in the cold, looking at the live tracking which was working at this point and showing the bus had already passed, I realised I should call customer service. Tells you a lot about a company when they do not put their customer service number on their ticket to make it easy to find. I ended up finding it on Google after a little digging because they are a European company so most of the top hits are European. No refund in sight and the agent was unwilling to help me find a later bus over the phone."

Plus we have to stop in Ritzville so the diesel bus can go through it's Re-Gen procedure as required... so when we hit Moses Lake .... Which usually allows passengers to get off the bus for fifteen minutes to stretch legs or go into convenience store at Ernie's ... He states only passengers getting ""OFF"" at Moses Lake can disembark and all other passengers must remain on bus...AND HE WENT IN AND WAS GONE FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES AND RETURNED TO THE BUS WITH A CONVENIENCE STORE 12-16 OZ PEPSI PRODUCT DRINK!!!!

Flixbus Global,Appalling - we were fans !,1,,2024-11-22T05:31:36.000Z,"A delayed, poorly identified replacement coach docking at a changed bay and appallingly poor communication all combined caused us, and a significant number of other passengers, to miss the 1005 (10.40hrs) service from Porto, Portugal yesterday. Despite arriving at the terminal one hour early, waiting at the original ‘cais D’ (bay) before moving to Q as instructed, a plain white (not the normal FlixBus green logos) replacement coach apparently arrived 15 to 20mins late and then departed without approximately 7 to 10 passengers, us included. Although we (and others) were in the immediate vicinity, there were no announcements and no local representatives (in their usual green uniforms) at Bay Q advising wrt this confusing situation. What transpired later is even more concerning as their Customer Service has revealed itself to be truly uncaring, evasive and corporately useless. If you think the FlixBus complaints and refund process is robust, contains escalation and recourse to independent review, please check their website and reconsider. We have previously travelled with FlixBus in different countries and enjoyed excellent service, and this is what makes today’s experience so shocking. It just shows that when things go wrong in whatever environment, true colours are then revealed. | Back to our experience today, having waited (at Bay Q) for some significant time after 11.00hrs, as a group of disappointed and confused travellers we decided to investigate and make alternative plans. After we had booked new tickets (with Rede Ex) we discovered a FlixBus representative and made enquiries about the original 1005 service only to discover it had ‘been and gone’. Impossible, we were at Bay Q ! After many questions and evasive answers, the true story of a ‘replacement white’ coach was revealed, that a number of complaints had been made and that passengers had been left behind. A forced apology was ultimately received along with the advice to claim a refund. Although not seeking any special attention, we mentioned that my wife currently has a broken wrist in plaster and that surely the original situation should have been better communicated. Unfortunately this was just greeted with a shrug and a smile ! | Once we arrived at our new destination we contacted FlixBus online as advised to claim a refund and complain. Unfortunately and as expected, this was a ‘hollow’ offer and there is zero interest in our situation or indeed obtaining an understanding any operational failings that created it. | Unfortunately our previous positive advertisement of FlixBus to our UK friends and family will now come to an end. They are like many corporations uninterested in real customer care and taking ownership of shortcomings, even in part. To our numerous fellow disappointed and frustrated travellers today, we hope you to managed to arrive at your chosen destination - we know one did because she travelled on the Rede Ex coach we were on | We will no doubt end up using FlixBus again however, this will only be if no other option is available. Thank you for your care and understanding today while we travel through wonderful Portugal. Yours disappointingly, Michael"

I stupidly left my suitcase on the Florence to Rome coach ( didn’t realise it would be a different bus for the Rome to Naples journey. | I reported the lost bag, was told they reply within 14 days. It’s now 7 weeks! Several ‘chats’ to the help service who ask me to be patient! They can’t contact lost and found and it’s not possible to speak to a human. | In this day and age e-mails take seconds so it should be easy to resolve? | They have however e-mailed me twice since for marketing purposes! | Good bus trip but terrible customer service-which is what counts!"
Flixbus Global,We were late leaving Victoria,2,,2024-11-21T12:23:49.000Z,"We were late leaving Victoria, but not by much so ok. I then find that the two seats I have booked and paid for together at the front due to travel sickness have been cnxld and I've been given seat 15c | The bus was far too hot with heat blasting continously. Because of our late departure we hit traffic on the motorway and arrived in Liverpool 1 hour and 40 minutes late. I have had no correspondence about a refund for the extra fee I paid for both seats together, won't be using them again that's for sure."

Flixbus Global,You Can't Make This Up,1,,2024-11-21T09:26:02.000Z,"I honestly don’t know where to start. Do I start with the incredibly rude driver? Maybe that we weren’t able to sit in the seats we reserved? How about the fact that there was no toilet paper or paper towels in the restroom? I know. WE ENDED UP IN GENOA! |  | When we arrived we asked one worker, who ended up being a co-driver, if we were at the right place. He did not speak English, which is fine. I showed him my phone with the reservation and he motioned to see the other driver. The other driver was so incredibly rude. Again, he did not speak Engilsh, which again, is fine. However, when I tried to show him my phone he just “shewed” me onto the bus, so we took that as confirmation that we were on the correct bus. We loaded our bags into baggage area, boarded the bus, and headed to the front and the very specific seats I paid extra to reserve. |  | Knowing we were driving through the Alps, we very specifically wanted the front row seats so we would have the best view. We had wanted to leave earlier, but those seats were not available, so we chose a later bus so we could get those front seats. However, as we arrived at what should have been our seats, the bus drivers’ stuff was on them, and another passenger told us we weren’t allowed to sit there. When the driver boarded, I tried to explain that we had reserved those seats but I basically was motioned to sit down. Looking at the seat labels, on this bus the front row was row 0 and the row behind that was row 1, the row we reserved. However, the seat map on the website clearly showed row 1 as the very first row. This is 100% false advertising. |  | So we took our seat and began to enjoy the ride. A couple of hours into the trip, I needed to go to the bathroom. As I sat down on the toilet, I realized there was no toilet paper nor paper towels. Well that sucked. Let’s just say I’m glad I was wearing socks and only needed to pee. |  | So we eventually stop in Turin, our destination. However, I don’t see “Vitorio Emmanuele” on any sign, which according to our reservation, is where we are to disembark. Again, I try to ask the rude driver if this is where we should exit, and he shewed me back onto the bus. So my assumption is that there is another stop in Turin and that one is ours. Well, about an hour later it was apparent that there was not another stop in Turin and based on another passenger’s conversation with the driver, our next stop was Genoa, another 4 hours away. |  | Cue a rush to notify our hotel in Turin that we would not check in until the following night as we didn’t want them to cancel our reservation. Definitely not happy that we’re paying for a hotel room we won’t stay in. We then had a mad search for a hotel room in Genoa. |  | The worst part of this was that the bus never stopped. 8 hours and we were unable to use a proper restroom (you know, one with toilet paper) and more importantly, 8 hours without the opportunity to get food or water. Luckily, we had a couple of bottles of water with us and some snacks, but my husband is diabetic and this situation could have been very, very bad for him."

Flixbus Global,Bus ride from hell,1,,2024-11-14T21:55:15.000Z,Im 61 and my friend is 56 and we get on the bus and the bus driver says very loudly “SIT ROW 3 OR BACK” and I politely say “we paid for row two and she loudly repeats “SIT ROW 3 OR BACK” | So we pick row 3. Then I proceed to put my small suitcase in the overhead storage and it wouldn’t fit and she yells “no bags with wheels” on the bus. And she’d literally just watched me struggle to get it up the stairs and said nothing. |  | Then the bus starts and another bus driver on the bus (I guess they switch off) stands up and says “ THERE WILL BE NO CUSSING ON THE BUS” and off we go. So we are barely out of the god forsaken parking lot and we start talking in a normal tone you would when sitting right beside someone. My friends voice is very soft. |  | The bus suddenly stops and the bus driver stands up and says “ if you want to talk on the bus MOVE TO THE BACK “ geared directly at us as nobody else was talking. |  | So needless to say the bus ride was not fun. We stopped and picked up a few more passengers in Baton Rouge and they didn’t get the seats they’d asked for so we told them it’s best to just pick a seat as that seems to be how it works. |  | After the bus starts going we have a bit of a conversation with the couple that just got on and AGAIN we hear the bus driver yell “ if you want to talk on the bus MOVE TO THE BACK “ |  | The two drivers talked to each other practically the whole trip cursing and swearing constantly. I will send the videos we got to their company who hopefully fires them. I have never had someone be so outrageous. But we were trapped for the duration of the trip.

Our driver was rude, shouting at people not to eat on the bus during the 3.5 hour journey. We only had 10 min stop which is not enough to have food and use the toilet. How are these drivers allowed to make their own rules?? From what I’ve read this is not an isolated case."

Flixbus Global,passengers in a city when under him he went down to have a coffee,3,,2024-11-14T15:51:32.000Z,"Unfortunately I can't say that I have good experience because I bought a ticket with my chair # 7C at this FLIXBUS company in Ottawa to Toronto on October 25-2024 at 12: pm. and when the driver got off and all the passengers also in a city to rest to go to the bathroom and have coffee; he did not announce how long he was going to last in that place, and all the normal passengers got off, the process was when he left and abandoned three passengers including me. That was desperate because I didn't know where I was and what place it was? The terrible thing was because the bus took my suitcase with all my personal things, it's been almost a month and I still haven't recovered my suitcase and the company hasn't taken responsibility because they say that in lost things Toronto is not my suitcase. Now I lost my ticket because I didn't reach the final destination, and I also lost my suitcase that the driver took on the bus. That's my anger and my bad experience with this company. |  | So who will be responsible for returning my suitcase? Is that part of the quality of service offered by the company? If the suitcase is lost, there is no responsibility on the part of the Iara company to make the return and that it will be the customer's later, I can understand that they do not care about the well-being of the customers"

I was told I could call back when I had confirmed I wanted the refund and upon calling back was again hung up on, then I called back and was told multiple times that the bus had left on time (which was a lie as we were waiting at the station the whole time). | I do not recommend anyone to book a trip with flixbus."
Flixbus Global,Nightmare with Flix Bus,1,,2024-11-12T05:12:02.000Z,"I booked Flix bus from Dc to Newyork to travel back on Monday from Newyork to DC, first of all the driver asks us to que si he can scan the tickets, then he decides to let us go in without scanning the tickets then I find my seat no is similar to another client when I go to ask him he decides to scan my ticket and asks me to sit anywhere. So we set off and when we get to Delaware he decides to give us a 15min bathroom break, we come back after 12 minutes and find the bus gone, unfortunately 4 other clients have been left, we try to call Netflix and our nightmare begins, then we realize we cannot get help here, so we find an alternative solution to DC and try to ask them to leave our luggage in DC, nightmare continues, they tell us to fill the lost and found online am wondering why fill lost and found and yet we know our bags are in that particular bus, anyhu they don’t help and we decide to go to union station to just check, nightmare continues, no one to help and we are just told to call customer service, we call again again the umpteenth time and the story is the same. As it is we have come back home without the apartments keys, thanks to the management they helped us go in. As it is I don’t have my work laptop and my 3 children’s suitcases, my sister’s suitcase and my backpack. Unfortunately we are from Africa and we will be going back home soon reading the reviews from Flix am not sure we will find our suitcases before we leave. Very unfortunate. I will and can never use Flix bus ever again or refer any of my family and friends. Quite unfortunate"

Flixbus Global,FlixBus: A Lesson in Subpar Customer Service,1,,2024-11-11T18:22:54.000Z,"I recently had an extremely frustrating experience with FlixBus that I need to share as a warning to others. On Nov 8, I mistakenly booked a same-day ticket that departed within 5 minutes of booking, intending to book for Nov 24. Realizing my error immediately, I tried to contact FlixBus support but had difficulty finding a phone number. |  | I first reached out through online chat, but the session froze or dropped. I started a second chat, selected the 'ask for a refund' dropdown, and waited over 30 minutes without a response. Leaving that chat open, I initiated a third chat from a different browser and chose an option related to changing my trip instead of a refund. This allowed me to reach a representative, but they refused to change my trip, give me a refund, escalate my complaint, or provide a phone number and abruptly ended the chat without helping me further. |  | I finally reached customer support by phone, where they acknowledged that I did not take the bus but still refused to provide a refund or transfer. Despite my prompt and multiple attempts to resolve the issue, FlixBus's rigid policies and dismissive customer service left me feeling ignored and unsupported. |  | In a climate where customer service is key, this was the worst service I have ever received. There are many similar bus companies, and FlixBus is not the only game in town. I will be avoiding both FlixBus and Greyhound in the future. If you’re considering using FlixBus, be aware of their inflexible service and poor support, especially when trying to rectify booking errors or seek assistance. Their lack of genuine customer care and unresponsive support channels made this experience deeply negative for me, and I would advise others to think twice before booking with them."

Flixbus Global,Rescheduling causing missed connections,1,,2024-11-11T11:28:48.000Z,"I will start this by saving I booked a return trip from Dijon to london with a 1.5hour pause at Paris to make the connection. This route was offered automatically on the flixbus website as a viable journey. | On the outward journey the bus was 2.5h late, so I got the tgv to Paris so that I would not miss my connection (Bercy bus station is not a pleasant place to be stranded waiting for the next bus). | On the return journey, I received an email saying that my bus would leave London an hour later than scheduled(23:59), which caused me to miss my connection in Paris. The thing that was more frustrating was that flixbus put a second bus on the same route at my original departure time - when I contacted customer support saying that this change in my journey would result in me missing my connection, the lady didn't understand the problem because she could see a route on the system at my departure time. Despite asking if she could modify my ticket, she thought I was trying to wind her up and left the chat. | At the bus station I repeated my problem to the bus driver of the earlier bus. His solution was to buy another ticket at 113€ to get on his bus. The guys in Victoria bus station tried to help but were overruled by the bus driver (route n710, 23:00 London Victoria to Paris Bercy 10th November 2024). | To make this constructive : Flixbus, please offer a free rescheduling of trips if your rescheduling of buses will cause passengers to miss their connection and need to spend hours in an unsafe foreign bus station."

We had to wait almost 40 min with many other passengers to finally realise it had suddenly disappeared from the the departure screen when another flixbus coach to Le Havre took its place on same platform. As it was Saturday, there was no one to call, we were all left on our own devices without any possibility to leave. | I had to quickly book online another two tickets double fare among the 4 left on the next coach leaving at 7.40 pm. I’ce spent way too much (4 tickets as a whole to be sure just to go back home, more than 120€ as a whole) and the company, whole I have written ( customer service not that easy to find on the site) DOESN’T WANT TO REFUND me the 2 extra tickets and denies this ghost ride which never showed up at any of the contiguous plateforms.

Flixbus Global,Denied boarding and company ignores refund requests,1,,2024-12-17T14:00:43.000Z,"Company ignores refund requests. I made repeated complaints and requests for refunds, repeated under different platforms (their provided contact form, email, social media), yet no response, only redirection to fill the form which they never get back to you from. | Update: after 3 months, they said they will give partial refund, they say their system shows I took it, even though I clearly didn't. |  | I was denied boarding, and my trip was not refunded when I asked. I ordered two hold luggage. When I went to board, the driver's system showed only one luggage, he said no, I showed him my ticket PDF and receipt which showed 2 hold luggage but he ignored me and went to turn on the bus, wanting to leave without me. The driver was also shouting and rude, for no apparent reason. This was 10 minutes before the bus is supposed to leave. He ignored my rightfully purchased ticket, and did not offer for me to buy an extra luggage which is what happens when someone brings a luggage they did not buy earlier, rather he just ignored me and walked away. A girl offered to take my bag under her ticket for me, since she was carrying no luggage. I went to ask the driver, and he started shouting without understanding or reasoning, “Are you crazy” and he started pushing the girl, pushing her on her breasts! And asking the girl’s group to all leave the bus. He then called the police. When the police came, he lied and stated that they wanted to force enter the bus and that he was only keeping them out. I saw it clearly, when I started talking to him, he did not ask them to leave and they did not resist, but rather he pushed first while shouting for them to leave. He was only stopped by the boys from the group, and I suspect he would have harassed or hit her even more if he was not stopped, because he was completely in rage and without reason. The driver showed unrestrained behavior, suggesting he is not to be trusted with luggage, his driving may not be safe, and that he might have caused me more problems later if I had boarded. This is why after he later changed his mind, for whatever reason, and told me I can board, I could not trust him and board the bus. This out of proportion reaction is hard to explain, for me simply asking to board my luggage that I actually purchased. |  | Now, I doubt and don't know if the system actually showed only one hold luggage, or if he said so for whatever reason to refuse to board me."

Flixbus Global,Bus Driver--large and in charge!,5,,2024-11-06T22:01:57.000Z,"First time travelers on FlixBus--and we'll do it again! The bus was comfortable, but lacked plug-ins and WiFi. However, our driver was exceptional and we were able to overlook the electronics issues. Our driver, Steve, was personable, treated each passenger w/ dignity, respect, friendliness, and was very helpful. His driving skills through city traffic was comforting and reassuring.

Flixbus Global,"Easy booking, trouble with reservation!",1,,2024-11-05T15:10:44.000Z,"Booking the reservation one day prior to my trip was extremely easy. I received my ticket with no problems, booked seat 14c and and showed up for my 3:30am trip to NYC from Philly. Upon arriving the entire bus was almost completely full except for a few seats and I made my way to the back where I had the reservation for. The driver didn’t wait for me to find my seat before accelerating hard enough I fell on top of some random sleeping person. Had the driver waited just one more minute, he would’ve noticed I discovered some lady was sitting in my seat and refused to get up, After showing her my reservation on my phone she insisted I go find a seat somewhere the f*** else and pretended to fall asleep instantly. There was someone sleeping along the back 3 seats and I took a seat on the floor in front of the bathroom, Minutes into the trip someone had to use the bathroom which woke up the person sleeping on the 3 seats and now allowed me to sit in a seat. Then someone from the row infront of me also sat in the back next to me and opened a can of some alcoholic beverage which he started to consume the entire trip. The previous sleeping person and the man drinking alcohol both kept switching spots in the back row or on the floor for the two hour trip. | All in all the trip on flixbus was a beyond awful two and a half hours. I’m not particularly sure what steps can be taken to improve on customers actually sitting in the seats they have reserved but there should be steps in place to prevent this from happening. I will probably find other transportation and won’t be riding on flixbus again in the future."
Flixbus Global,Stockholm Central to airport,1,,2024-11-07T23:24:46.000Z,"Purchased a bus ticket from Stockholm Central to Arlanda airport. The first driver couldn't take us as we were 15 minutes too early, then next was late and didn't stop for 3 passengers. He clearly saw us and drove straight on. Queried it with their head office almost a month ago. Received a reply yesterday that we had boarded their bus(joke we hadn't we paid far more paying on another companies busline last minute) and they're sorry but can't refund us. Utter hogwash. | Their reply says that they're working on things with their customer service, that's not the case they've replied laughably that we can't have a refund because of their self imposed administration fee of 17 dollars. Apparently it would cost them too much from their company to refund us our ticket money. Not to mention the amount we then paid for another companies bus that was cheaper to buy online but we had to buy while boarding. | Very disappointed with these guys. Never ever again."

Flixbus Global,PLEASE AVOID SHOULD BE CALLED FLIXBIN,1,,2024-11-07T07:14:57.000Z,"On August 28, 2024, I purchased a bus ticket from Portugal to London, UK. During the transfer from Lille, France, to our final destination in London, my niece and two daughters were refused boarding by the bus driver. He claimed that their Portuguese ID cards did not allow them to enter the UK. I explained that the UK Government permits travelers with EU ID cards, who have settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme, to enter until 2025. Despite showing him this information and the children’s settled status, he continued to deny us boarding. His behavior was rude, disrespectful, and discriminatory. I have never faced such treatment before. The driver shouted at us, humiliating us and making derogatory comments, as if we were illegal immigrants. This lack of knowledge on his part caused us significant financial loss and left us stranded in an unfamiliar country with three children. The way we were treated was inhumane. There was no support from the coach company despite me calling them several times and they even acknowledge the wrongdoing of the driver, but provided me with no resolution. Up to this date they haven’t Refunded me my money or resolved the complaint. |  | Your costumer service is like contacting a dead end, you just get robotic answers just like the one I received for this review so solution, just refund me my money back."

I need to travel from 64th Ave to the 1st Ave. Flipbus drove from 1st Ave, and go pass 64th Ave. Would be good if the bus can add a stop along the way, e.g. Richmond Casino, or a Sky train station at Richmond. This would save me 1.5 hours of travel time."
Flixbus Global,"Flixbus sent false delay, causing me to miss my bus",1,,2024-11-04T07:59:19.000Z,"I received a notification from Flixbus saying my bus was delayed by 30 minutes, then an hour. But when I arrived at the bus stop, no one could help me find my bus until one worker finally said that the Flixbus app mistakenly sent out that notification and my bus had actually left at its original time. He said I had to buy a new ticket, which would cost $140 at that point. The Flixbus website repeatedly gave me an error message and would not let me a buy a new ticket. I was crying at this point because I couldn’t afford a way home. There were 2 men who seemed to care about my situation and wanted to help me. One of them reassured me he would get me onto the next bus to my city and he would take care of it. Unfortunately, he was on his break when the bus arrived, but there was a different worker who said I could get on if I had $40 in cash. All I had was $17, but he talked to the bus driver and the bus driver very generously let me onto the bus. It was an incredibly distressing experience that would have been even worse if not for the help of these people."

I did not receive any proof of payment, nor any invoice, and even worse that the two Polish drivers asked me for cash, in no case payment by credit card. A complaint has already been made to the company's head office. (I have video and audio evidence if necessary) |  | It is obvious that here the employees are selected wrongly. It would be good to analyze what are in this case, the annual Flixbus losses, in relation to the number of employees and the number of cheated or non-reported customers |  | The company can not operate without customers, and this is where the locations are not videotaped and where the drivers can afford to cheat the customer and the Flixbus company. |  | Help the customers, the firm thrives, or help the criminals beat the road to bankruptcy. |  | Subsequent to my complaint about WiFi not being open to passengers at all, (although in the presentation it is clearly suggested that all buses offer free WiFi) and reference to luggage, the drivers communicated the incident among themselves and the whole customer comes out doubly in the dock. |  | Calculating from the agitated reaction of the drivers and their subsequent discussions, and the telephone information between employees, it is obvious that a sanction or dismissal of the two offenders is necessary. |  | Ideal to consider also if this is only happening on non-video monitored locations like mine or everywhere? What is the frequency, countries and what are the total losses? Prosperity or bankruptcy?"

Left my phone on the bus, and the bus driver, who spoke practically zero English, called the last person I dialed, so there is a record that he found the phone on the bus, but the company has a policy of making people wait up to 14 days to retrieve lost items, including cell phones. They have no phone number on their Web site. I had to take a day off work to go back to their NYC site just to be told my item wasn't there, even after filling out their ""lost and found"" form online, and that it could be anywhere on the Eastern seaboard and given a number to call. The people I spoke to on the phone essentially said ""don't call us again, and while we acknowledge we have your item, we will return it when we decide to."" Also, no Wi-Fi on the bus as promised and the driver drove like a demon out of hell with lots of sharp breaking and weaving in traffic. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!! I will deal with companies that aren't just interested in grabbing your money and don't seize and probably re-furbish and sell their passengers' lost items."

Surprisingly, rather than escalating the situation, the lady chose to sit elsewhere with her daughter. |  | Later, it turned out that the person was actually saving the seat for a friend with a bag, and she had not been displaced at all. It was quite unbelievable! In such scenarios, it’s really important to ensure people respect seating assignments, especially when seats are paid for. I believe there should be a system in place to verify that everyone is seated correctly. If it had been me, I would have spoken to the bus driver to resolve the issue or would have Gone NY On her , This is just a suggestion for better seating management to avoid any unnecessary confusion."

That had mostly to do with all the interruptions that stop you from sleeping (2x passport and bag control in Calais and Dover, 1x passport control in the bus, 2x adding more passengers, 1x general pause, waiting for the boat, going on and off the boat). The seats were comfortable though, so maybe another route without all these interruptions would work for me. Also the live information about the buses is not working.

I lost my bags which had lots of stuff including expensive electronics. Another passenger was also stranded. There is zero customer support. Not even at the bus station. I am going to sue these guys for the horrible treatment they put through.
Flixbus Global,Worst customer service I've ever endured,1,,2024-11-01T09:08:59.000Z,"We had a terrible experience on our return trip from Amsterdam Sloterdijk to Paris Bercy Seine. After we lost our luggage in one of their buses, Flixbus's customer service has been more unhelpful than I thought was possible. |  | Basically, when leaving from Sloterdijk station in Amsterdam, there were two Flixbus buses going to Paris within 15 minutes of each other. They were parked next to each other. One was the 800 bus and the other (which we had booked for) was the X800. We put our bag on the 800 bus - seeing the destination and what we thought was the correct number. The 800 left 15 minutes earlier than the X800 and took our luggage with it. | In a panic, we went to the Flixbus booth at the station to try get help from the agent there. He wasn't helpful, did not offer to get in touch with the driver or the Paris station and told us to just report our lost luggage on the website. We then tried using the online chat to explain our story and try get in touch with the driver but again we were told to report our lost luggage using the online form. All this despite the fact that we knew where our luggage was and that we would be arriving at the same station! |  | So we reported our lost luggage and hoped that we would arrive at Paris and be able to grab our bag there. It was an incredibly stressful journey. |  | Unfortunately, there was traffic driving into Paris and we arrived about 30 minutes after the 800 bus. By the time we arrived, our bags were probably sitting in a bus somewhere at the station but the driver was nowhere to be seen. We tried to explain our situation to a Flixbus employee we saw in the parking lot and he said there was nothing he could do and we would have to go through the lost luggage procedure. We also waited an hour in the line at the ticket office to chat to the Flixbus agent there. He tried to help us but didn't have access to get the registration number of the 800 bus where our luggage was. It was the first time someone actually tried to help. |  | The absolute lack of common sense we saw from Flixbus employees as well as the bureaucracy of the lost luggage process is a joke. We now have to wait for two weeks and hope that they get back to us with our luggage. The whole process is opaque with no updates. I don't have high hopes but even if we get our luggage back, this experience has been overwhelmingly negative. |  | Wifi was fine. Drivers were nice. Bus smelled like urine on our first leg to Paris. |  | Edit: the reply to this review from Flixbus states that drivers' information such as contact numbers cannot be shared due to GDPR. We did not request the drivers' contact information so this is a weird reply. We asked Flixbus themselves to contact the drivers on our behalf, which would absolutely be fine according to GDPR, but would require a degree of problem-solving and customer care that Flixbus support is apparently not capable of."

Flixbus Global,Edinburgh-Glasgow route - make sure you know your departure stop,1,,2024-10-27T20:40:38.000Z,"I've used Flixbus a few times, but this is the first time on an Edinburgh-Glasgow service. Love the seats compared to the Citylink / Ryanair affair. However, I'm irritated that I turned up at the bus station, after jogging in the rain, in Edinburgh a few minutes before departure, only to discover that my return journey to Glasgow departed from a different location due to the fact that Flixbus didn't have a licence to use the bus station on a Sunday after a certain time. |  | The way this information is communicated on the website / by email is not clear, nor is the logic of different departure points immediately clear to me. |  | I'll continue to use Flixbus for countrywide journeys as Citylink has become a rip-off, but not the Edinburgh-Glasgow, route as this is nonsense. |  | Paid to get on the Citylink. Will do so in future for this route. However, great work on the Glasgow to Aberdeen/Inverness routes, though consider more stops north of the Drumochter Pass on the A9 other than simply Aviemore, e.g. Kingussie or Newtonmore - it would help the non-driving hillwalker"

But it was a bit slow. | Seat had power connection. But there is no USB port. Bus had the right temperature inside. Overhead lamp was not working. There was enough luggage space. |  | Asking us to pay extra to choose a seat was a bit odd even though we booked several weeks in advance. |  | Also, the real-time location shown in Flixbus tracker was inaccurate. There's at least 15 minutes of timelag from the actual location to what is shown on their tracker page for our bus. Since we had someone pick us up at the destination we resorted to location sharing via Google Maps.

Horrible when its horrible!! | NEVER book another Greyhound bus thru Flix. | Booked a bus for 10:15pm. Around 9:40pm, they began updating that the bus would be delayed up to 2 hours (per online chat agent). I stayed on the online chat from about 9:45 up until 10:30, when I realized that an ACTUAL Flixbus was arriving in the lot. I looked online and saw that it was the 10:40 bus, which is actually closer to the time I typically departs using Flix. The online agent could not assist me in securing a ticket and exchange seat reservation and time was ticketing away. Thankfully, I spoke with the driver that recommended I use the station customer service. At 10:38, I received a ticket for the 10:40 bus and was able to board, no thanks to online support. I wouldn't be surprised if the Greyhound bus never arrived, as it was still showing in the Baltimore port as I was pulling out from the station at 10:40. One of the worst experiences to date using Flix! No refund offered, no voucher offered for the hassle, nothing."
Flixbus Global,Not worth it,1,,2024-10-26T16:19:06.000Z,"Bus departure was delayed because of a battery issue (it needed a jump). The driver and the bus stop employees had no idea when the issue was going to be resolved, and started suggesting that everyone should get tickets to the next available buses. A friend and I did so. Eventually the battery issue was resolved, and the original bus was leaving before the new bus we had purchased tickets for, so naturally we got on the original bus. |  | Customer service informed us that it was not possible to get a refund for the new bus tickets we did not end up using. We also could not get any refunds for the original delayed trip, because the final delay was just two minutes shy of 120 minutes. I understand these are policies that are determined in the T&C, and I accept that and was actually not expecting any refunds. What I’m really disappointed about is the lack of communication about the delay (the first email we actually got from Flixbus about the delay was 1.5 hrs after our bus was scheduled to leave) and the not-so-good advice the employees were giving out (though I don’t blame them, would not be surprised if they haven’t been trained on these situations). |  | After my return trip this Sunday I can safely say I will not be using Flixbus again. Even though it’s pretty cheap, it’s just not worth the hassle for me."

Flixbus Global,An Unsafe and Unprofessional Experience with FlixBus - Never Again!!,1,,2024-10-26T00:09:53.000Z,"An Unsafe and Unprofessional Experience with FlixBus - Never Again |  | I recently traveled with FlixBus from Hannover to Amsterdam, and it was by far the most disappointing and concerning experience I have ever had with a transportation service. I urge anyone considering this company to seriously reconsider due to the carelessness and unprofessionalism of their drivers, which put all passengers at risk. |  | To start, the bus arrived 1 hour and 30 minutes late with no communication or updates about the delay. This lack of organization and customer service set a negative tone from the beginning, and things only went downhill from there. |  | An hour into the trip, the bus shockingly collided with a stationary car on the highway. This was no minor incident—it took over two hours to resolve the situation, all while passengers were left waiting with no clear information. The situation was mishandled at every turn, showcasing a complete lack of preparedness and professionalism by FlixBus. |  | The situation only worsened when a new driver took over. This driver, visibly angry, drove aggressively, speeding and disregarding passenger comfort. His attitude toward passengers was openly hostile, creating a tense and uncomfortable atmosphere. This reckless behavior added yet another layer of danger to an already hazardous journey. |  | Overall, this journey with FlixBus was unacceptable on multiple levels. The company’s disregard for passenger safety, the lack of professional conduct from its drivers, and the utter lack of transparency left me and others feeling vulnerable and uneasy. Based on this experience, I strongly recommend avoiding FlixBus for your travel needs. Safety and professionalism should be paramount for any travel company—FlixBus, unfortunately, falls short on both counts."

When I told him I didn’t know what the regulations were, he became visibly annoyed. He then told me that the coffee I had with me couldn’t go on the bus. When I boarded, I saw that the reserved seat I had purchased was occupied by someone else. There were no other available seats that I could see. So I left, and did not make the trip.

Flixbus Global,STAY AWAY FROM FLIXBUS!,1,,2024-10-25T03:54:59.000Z,"ZERO STARS |  | That trip from Lethbridge to Edmonton I will never forget. The driver was extremely, unbelievably rude and I have witnesses to prove it. In Lethbridge I knocked on the door to check if the bus was the one to Edmonton. The driver opened the door and started yelling at me that he was on a break. He wasted more time yelling than he would have had answering my question. Then he tried to close the automatic bus door while I was standing there. The door hit me and hurt my back (the pain did not go away). Tomorrow, I am going to see my doctor. If there is indeed injury, I will call my lawyer. I am serious. I have two witnesses to attest to the above statement; they were scandalised by driver's behaviour. |  | In Edmonton, I had to drag my heavy bag from the luggage compartment by getting inside it, as the bag was pushed very deep towards the middle of the bus. Not only did the driver not help me (I have very limited ability to use my right hand), he laughed loudly when I hit my head against compartment's lifted door. It was so rude, unprofessional, inconsiderate that the person whom I accompanied on the trip as a guide, a distinguished artist from Europe, said that we should leave the station as soon as possible because she ""could not stand that absolutely rude driver"". When I told the driver that I'd contact FlixBus about these incidents, he laughed and mockingly said ""Go ahead, call them!"". |  | Throughout the trip, the driver was very unpleasant to several other people, he often raised his voice. In general, he represented your company in the worst possible way. During our trip from Edmonton to Lethbridge there were already signs of the driver's true nature, but the return trip proved the worst travelling experience in my entire life."
Flixbus Global,Flixbus is amazing,5,,2024-10-25T03:50:47.000Z,Flixbus is amazing ! It's a game changer as far as coach bus travel goes. I live in Kingston but my family lives in Niagara and I took a bus home and the first one was $65 and when I booked one back it was only $35 and each one would absolutely smoothly and there's so many options it doesn't matter what day I wanted to go there were departure times every single day. I feel that now I'm going to be traveling home much more now and I have Flex Bus to think for that it's literally cheaper than gas and it's pretty much the same amount of time !
Flixbus Global,Horrible experience,1,,2024-10-24T22:06:22.000Z,"Horrible experience. Absolutely unhelpful and careless staff. | So here's the story: I booked my trip as a ""fun ride"" with my son. I don't travel with bus and just wanted to enjoy the panoramic view and a have nice trip. I paid extra fee for the front panorama seats to fullfil the kids wish. I had a hotel booked and paid for in the destination. On the way getting to the station we missed our connection to get there on time, so I grab my e-scooter in order to catch the bus. We arrived on time and we just get ""Im not taking you with the scooter"" from the driver. ""It's in T&C, not my problem"", enters the bus and drives away in front of our eyes. After the crying is over, we go to the ticket office if we can get another connection (we would keep the scooter in the luggage storage), or at least a refund. ""No sorry, can't do anything. Go and fill a form on the web"". So I go to the web, of course the form is well hidden, so I contact the support there. ""It's in the T&C, your problem"". | My fault?

When I contacted customer service, they informed me my bus had already left and I’d need to buy a new ticket. |  | This is completely unacceptable—a clear failure of service and a blatant rip-off.

Flixbus Global,Appalling experience,1,,2024-10-24T08:52:27.000Z,"What a shocking experience. Astounded that such a vehicle is allowed on the roads. Non functioning toilet in a dilapidated bus that should have been removed off the roads long ago. Not a single functioning power / USB point, tray tables loose and not maintained, seats could not adjust, and then mechanical issues with the vehicle too. And it arrives two hours late, so you miss your connecting travel. And Flixbus' standard response - you boarded the bus, so no refund or any compensation. How are you supposed to make alternative plans after you were supposed to depart? Zero ""delay repay"" type of compensation. Like what else are you supposed to do - you're at your departure point and then get told 30 mins after you were supposed to leave that the bus will be there in a further hour's time. Appalling company. Completely unreliable. And don't bother making plans at all at your destination until such time as you actually arrive as they are always late, and usually by 2 or more hours."

This proves the ethos of the company. Thus company is a complete scam. | They in response to my review acknowledge that they are racist and they left 3 passengers in the middle of no where. They also acknowledge that they are the one who commit the crime, they themselves judge and also provide judgement. | They hide some facts saying issue is resolved, truth is it's not resolved. they had not yet actioned to return the bags. After mutiple calls to their customer care ( who on record accept that it's a big mess) they have not actioned on returning my luggage. They very cleverly put me through a system where I complain for lost and found so that the ownership of the issue is passed on to the passengers. | I even did that but since 48 hours no respose. Note this is an emergency helpline. Here the bus operators has fled with passengers bags including their passport. | Request all passengers to be mindful of this service and if possible avoid in all case. | My booking 3204227385 | Route 1012 | LISBON TO POTEMEO ON 21ST Oct. | They will do all they can to suppress this matter as request passengers to support my case and boycott them.

There were no movies or entertainment on board. |  | I had to PAY to book my seat. And both journeys someone has been sitting in my seat and I had to ask them to move. Flix should have reserved signs on theses seats. Actually, Flixbus should not even charge to reserve a seat! |  | I have used other bus companies in Europe with far superior service and cheaper too. Shop around. |  | EDIT: unfortunately I had to take a 3rd journey with Flixbus, as the train was sold out. Once again, no wifi for my 7-hour ride. At least there was running water and TP this ride."

Flixbus Global,Nice bus ride but less flexible on ticket management process,4,,2024-10-22T06:58:51.000Z,Great bus ride and nice clean bus. I was taking a trip from Geneva airport to Annecy. I had originally booked the ticket from the Geneva central station but then realized there was a closer stop at the airport. I attempted to change the ticket but the system and Cust service said this wasn’t possible so I had to buy another ticket and attempt a refund. They charged me a $25 cancellation fee and only gave me a credit rather than a refund. Secondly the signage and website directions to the bus station were inadequate. Had to wonder around Geneva airport to locate the pick up location. Aside from that it was good value but had to work hard to make this a successful trip
Flixbus Global,Don’t use this bus line!,1,,2024-10-22T03:44:39.000Z,"Do yourself a favor and don’t take this bus. Use any other line.

Then you go in and surprise there is no AC. On a 6 hour drive through the desert. Also there is no WiFi or at least it never showed up and again staff refused to answer questions but were happy to let everyone know that they would leave them on the stop if they weren’t there at a NON SPECIFIC TIME!

Mind you I was at the bus terminal. I also asked to speak with a supervisor and was denied then I asked for a code where I wouldn’t have to pay the $42 again for a mistake I made 5 mins ago. Flix wanted me to pay $84 in time corrections for a $37 ticket ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS! If the company needs to save money get rid of the useless customer service department. I wonder if I will even hear from someone about this complaint? Not a good way to treat your customers especially a first timer .
Flixbus Global,Smooth ride,5,,2024-10-21T17:58:44.000Z,I had a nice bus experience. The driver was very polite and prompt.

It was my first time travelling from Ottawa to Toronto. We were supposed to get to union station at 11:10 pm. Now that I am writing this review it is 11:57 pm we are not even in Toronto yet. I wouldn’t choose it if I knew the bus stops in many cities. It’s dishonest to claim to be the fastest and give exact time but not even getting close to it. Very unhappy.

Flixbus Global,I strongly recommend trying other options,1,,2024-10-21T02:52:03.000Z,"I rarely write reviews, but this situation deserves it. Yesterday, I had a scheduled trip from New York with a departure at 3:45 p.m. We boarded the bus right at that time, and half an hour later, we were informed that it was canceled due to a technical problem. They told us we would be reassigned to another bus, but they didn’t provide any further explanations. |  | At 4:15 p.m., we received an email informing us that we had to catch a new bus at 5 p.m., but from another station 5 km away. We had to run with our luggage those 5 km across the city and arrived just 2 minutes before the new bus departed. Furthermore, the new route took longer, so we arrived 2 hours late at our destination. |  | We contacted Flixbus to express our dissatisfaction, and their response was that since we made it to the bus, the service was considered complete, and there was nothing more to say. I don't know how the service is with other companies, but it's clear that Flixbus doesn't care about the well-being of its passengers. I strongly recommend trying other options."
Flixbus Global,Last minute cancellation of trip,1,,2024-10-22T19:11:00.000Z,"Update: note Flixbus's snarky response to my review: |  | ""We can confirm that the case resolution was in accordance to our Terms and Conditions, which you agreed to upon booking the ticket."" |  | To which I have this to say: DO NOT travel with Flixbus. If they cancel a bus at the last minute, you'll be left with no options other than a cancellation. Paid a lot of money or spent a lot of time commuting to the departure terminal? Tough! Flixbus doesn't care. They think rebooking you on another bus hours later is sufficient to make up for the inconvenience. And when you complain, they'll simply tell you to suck it up. If you MUST travel with Flixbus for whatever reason, be prepared for the worst and allow time for getting screwed over by the bus line. |  | Hey, Flixbus customer service: thanks for your complete lack of understanding! You're the worst! |  | ---- |  | Bus was cancelled after I arrived at the departure station. Was rebooked on a later bus but customer service was unsympathetic about the inconvenience this caused me. No phone support. I had to commute to the station via public transit, and a phone call letting me know about the cancellation would have saved me three hours of standing around doing nothing. Bus was dirty and other passengers didn’t respect the seat reservations. I had paid for a specific seat that was unavailable on the rebooked bus, and getting a refund took a lot of effort. Overall a bad experience."

Check the reviews for Hak Bus, who services this route for Flixbus, before booking. The bus driver almost got in a fistfight before leaving the bus terminal. He made me take a photo with him like some sort of circus animal because I'm black. The bus regularly arrives SEVERAL hours late because they stop every 5 minutes at stations that don't accept card. There is NO ac and the only person with a window is the driver, which he only opens to smoke his cigarettes and choke you out with his secondhand smoke. The bus is 100% full with zero airflow for ventilation."

Flixbus Global,Delayed bus,4,,2024-10-19T12:21:27.000Z,I received an email notification that the bus was delayed. The return trip between Fatima and Lisbon did not give me confidence because the bus made strange noises on the treads.
Flixbus Global,Not so good overall,2,,2024-10-19T12:16:04.000Z,"On both the one-way and return, the drivers drove so fast that we arrived way before the time scheduled...Times of arrival should be more accurate to allow better planning for the customers. | On the return, some seats were free to choose for customers, which completely reshuffled the assignments of seat, forcing couples/friends to split. People with no seat allocated should get in the bus after the others. On the same return, the A.C. was not working properly and we were all dying of heat. It took a couple of hours to get fixed. This should be checked before departure."

They departed and kept waiting there for a long time until i reached out to customer support, they said my bus was actually a grayhound bus not FlixBus. Nowhere in the app it said that information and the driver just looked at my FlixBus app and said that his bus was not my bus. The customer service agent name Nadja said they were not going to provide a refund. I tried at least changing my reservation to another time, they couldn’t even do that either. I am very sure they could have accommodated me in another bus but they didn’t so I lost my money and had to purchase a flight ticket. I am very upset with my experience"
Flixbus Global,Bad experience.,2,,2024-10-18T16:51:17.000Z,"First time using Flixbus, from London to Spain. | The bus left an hour late, nobody was notified of this beforehand. | The first problem was with the seating. I reserved a seat, however, the driver stated, this was not possible and that everyone could sit wherever they liked. | The driver left 8 of us in Calais as he drove off the ferry without doing a headcount, or waiting, even though we were not late back to the bus. | The staff at Calais ferry terminal said this was a frequent occurrence with Flixbus. | Stranded in Calais, customer service for Flixbus were extremely unhelpful and stated we were all late back to get on the bus and there was nothing they could do. They stated we could find our own way to the next transfer point, at our own expense. | I travelled independently to the next transfer point after waiting for Flixbus to rectify the situation, however after 2 hours, it was evident they were not going to help. | I met my transfer in Paris, continued my journey and finally arrived at my destination. | The buses on the trip were cramped and not comfortable for such a long trip. The transfers to another bus on route were too frequent and the average transfer time was 2 hours, one part of the journey is a 5 hour wait time to board the next bus. | The return journey was better, although, the first bus left early, the transfers were still frequent and long. The bus missed our ferry and we were advised by the driver to sleep for four hours while waiting to board the next one! Flixbus would not accept responsibility for this and refused to refund additional costs that were incurred by having to pay for another ticket as I was not able to make my transfer and had already paid for a ticket. | Overall, not a great service experience. | Cheap travel is the good thing, although once you buy your ticket, you soon realise you are just an inconvenience to the drivers and are not treated with much respect. | I will not be using their service again."

When I got back to the bus, the doors were open, but he started yelling at me in front of everyone because I didn't tell him I was going to drink water, even though it took a minute. Even when I got back, the bus doors hadn't closed. He made me get into the bus with difficulty, even when I showed him my ticket and told him my bag was inside."
Flixbus Global,Great Ride but poor communications,3,,2024-10-18T06:44:12.000Z,"The company operates in many different areas so this review is only for the service between Copenhagen and Malmo in Sweden. I’m sure many customers use the service for regular commuting as it calls at the airport for collection before heading to Sweden. But there were many, like me, who make the journey to experience crossing the famous Øresund bridge. I’m sure the company know this yet on both crossings the windscreen clearly hadn’t been cleaned for many days spoiling the view. Furthermore, I (again like many I’m sure) used YouTube videos to ascertain where the collection points were. Sadly these videos are misleading as they are out of date. This led to asking local people and others for directions. It is possible to get this information on the FlixBus website but only if you Track your Journey. Surely the company should automatically send detailed information once tickets are secured? For us, the outbound journey was from a newly constructed bus terminal further away from where it used to be. It looks like when the signage systems are up and running, FlixBus will be a major user of this terminal. The return journey started at a multi laned bus terminal with no signage at all and it was over 600m from the Hyllie station named on the ticket. All this caused much stress. We arrived with only a minute to spare on the outbound journey. Could be much better."

Consequently, it took me a minute (literally *ONE* minute) to figure out which bus to get on, and by that time the bus was pulling away.

It was only billed as a 1h20 journey. What’s the worst that could happen, I asked myself. Well what happens is you get stopped at the Italian border for over an hour, the police storm the bus and take your passports, with no indication of when you’ll see the passports again. Zero communication from the bus staff who just used it as a smoking break, meanwhile I miss my onward train and waste a day. So much for Schengen. If they know about these border delays why do they not warn about it anywhere on their website or in emails. They’ve been spamming me telling me that USB sockets and toilets are out of order, but not the way more important thing that I might never get to my destination. While the drivers don’t have control over the overzealous border force they do have control over communication. This is NOT a 1 h 20 journey. Do NOT use this to get from Slovenia to Italy. You will never reach your destination."

It was a horrible experience for my young son who was travelling for the first time by bus alone. Bus leaving Kingston picked up at the side of a road. No bus shelters at this location or benches. People on the bus ahead of him had a delayed bus and had no idea what was happening. This made my son concerned for his bus coming home as he was lucky and his original bus did come. However, on his way home, his bus was delayed. The notification came when the bus was supposed to be at the gate already. Obviously the bus carrier already knew the bus would be late but they did not advise the riders until the moment that their bus was to be there. It was over an hour and a half late, and he might have missed it as the carrier did not update the app with information about a gate change. Thankfully the bus terminal staff let people know. When I messaged Flix Bus about information on where the incoming bus was coming from, I received a ridiculous explanation how they could not advise this for privacy issues. Seriously, privacy? The staff via chat were not helpful, were unkind and not understanding. They did not try to provide good service or try to help a concerned mother."

Flixbus Global,Communication to customers needs improvement,2,,2024-10-14T14:16:42.000Z,"I’ve used Flixbus a few times in the past and had positive experiences. This time the bus was more than 2 hours late. On October 12 evening I received an email at 6:25pm saying that the bus departing that night at 7:10pm from Dresden train station to Berlin airport was delayed 85minutes. After this there was no additional communication and the bus did not arrive until 9:37pm. This was much later than initially communicated and there was no information after the initial email to provide an update on the bus. All the customers had to sit outside in the cold at the bus stop for over an hour. There was an old man who was not very healthy at the bus stop, after standing outside for a time he fell over and other customers had to help lift him off the ground. It was possible to track the bus via the app but I didn’t have the ability to download at the time so luckily other travelers kept me updated, but it was extremely nerve-wracking because my flight departed next morning 6:15am so I needed to return to Berlin without fail. I’m glad the bus finally came but the communication needs to be improved going forward."
Flixbus Global,Absolutely awful experience travelling…,1,,2024-10-14T13:43:02.000Z,"Absolutely awful experience travelling from Gatwick to Bristol on Tuesday 8th of October. The aircon was blowing out hot air and there was no windows on the bus. It was showing as over 40 degrees and was becoming increasingly unbearable for myself as I’m 22 weeks pregnant, but also many other travellers. I began to feel faint and quite panicky from feeling claustrophobic. I went to speak with the driver to ask her to please stop the bus when it was safe to do so as I needed some air as I felt extremely faint. She was very rude and said that it wasn’t safe to stop, that everyone was hot and she wouldn’t stop until we reached Bristol. This then turned into an argument where she stopped the bus and threatened to call the police to throw me off! So she could stop the bus to do this but couldn’t stop the bus to give me air. She finally stopped at a service station an hour later and then refused to drive. Eventually about 55 mins later we all got back on the bus and continued on to Bristol in the same horrible conditions! When I contacted flix bus they said they wouldn’t refund me. I would never use their bus again or recommend them to anyone."

Flixbus Global,This company is a predatory scam,1,,2024-10-13T17:28:47.000Z,"This company is a predatory scam. I bought a ticket and reserved a seat for a bus that as far as I know, never came. I encourage everyone reading this to only purchase from flixbus if you’re willing to waste more than an hour of your time and if you’re excited to be blatantly lied to. The bus was scheduled for 2:35 and I received a message that it was 36 minutes late. At 3:25 I called to ask where the bus was, and the customer service representative said the bus would be coming in 15 minutes. They lied, they said they were 100% the bus was coming in 15 minutes, and at 4:08 I gave up on waiting. All I got in compensation was more lies about how I had been checked in (my ticket was never scanned) and how that since they hadn’t wasted at least 2 hours of my time, that the 1.5 hours of my time that had been wasted was not their fault or their concern. I will never ride flixbus or any of its affiliates again, and if you do, you’re gambling on spending your money on poor customer service and a bus that may never come."

Flixbus Global,Worst experience over the thanksgiving…,1,,2024-10-13T14:42:36.000Z,"Worst experience over the thanksgiving weekend ever. Our daughter who is 16 was refused entry for the trip to collingwood from Toronto. Her mother was with her to drop off at Pearson int. I was to pick her up in collingwood. Their policy is incomprehensible. Apparently it’s not over 16 but rather some obscure other age that she needs to be closer to 17. It makes absolutely no sense. We were traveling over international borders by plane well below that age. Regardless I needed to drive to toronto to pick her up and back to collingwood (4 hours) so she could be there to work at her job at a winery sat morning. Also, it was Thanksgiving weekend. This company threw off the entire weekend. Their customer service handled it incredibly poorly. The gatekeeper was unhelpful and was not interested in resolving anything or even allow me to speak with a manager. A horrible experience."
Flixbus Global,Unacceptable bus delay,1,,2024-10-13T14:19:55.000Z,"My bus from Dresden to Berlin airport did not arrive on time. I was waiting for a bus at the bus stop for a very long time and, as I was scared to miss my plane in Berlin, I had to take another bus going to Berlin. As a result , I had to pay twice for this trip. It is unacceptable. No punctuality and disrespect to the passengers. I am very disappointed. We can’t rely on the bus service"

Flixbus Global,Easy to use system,5,,2024-10-12T19:12:15.000Z,Easy to use system. Has a lot of extra options (like booking additional seat). Very flexible platform and easy to navigate site. I would say that only thing I saw an issue with is the address listed for the Kiev Bus Station was different than what comes in Google. It could confuse other people if they try to input the address versus the coordinates.
Flixbus Global,Bait and Switch,1,,2024-10-16T21:17:42.000Z,The company sold the ticket but another company actually did the actual transport. I was looking forward to trying them as I had heard good things. Maybe if they had used their own vehicle instead of a contractor to save money...But not worth paying a Flixbus price for a back-breaking ride.
Flixbus Global,Bus never came,1,,2024-10-12T15:08:26.000Z,I was emailed that my bus would be 81 minutes late to depart. I arrived 30 mins before the new departure time and waited at the bus stop for hours with many others and the bus never came. I was on with customer support chat who told me the bus came at the original departure time and was not delayed. I had to buy a second ticket for a bus departing 4 hours after my original departure time. Later I called customer service who told me the bus did in fact depart 2 hours late. I told them that the bus did not depart at that time because I was there and there was no bus. They told me there is nothing they can do and they cannot give me a refund but only a voucher because the bus was not cancelled according to their system. All in all I had to pay for 2 bus tickets to get home 4 hours later than I had originally purchased the tickets for.

Because of this, I decided to take the train instead, even though I had already paid for the bus. |  | On the return trip, the bus left on time, but we were delayed for over an hour due to a random inspection. While I understand that this wasn’t FlixBus’s fault, I couldn’t help but feel that spending a little more on a train would have been more reliable. Based on this experience, I won’t be using FlixBus again and don’t recommend it to others."

Horrible Service and Rude Drivers,1,,2024-10-08T19:08:52.000Z,"I’m absolutely disgusted by the experience I had with FlixBus and the way they handled my complaint. A few days ago, while waiting at the Broxden Park & Ride, I mistakenly boarded a bus headed for Aberdeen. The driver’s reaction? Completely rude and dismissive! Instead of a polite response to a simple question, I was met with a condescending and aggressive tone, embarrassing me in front of other passengers. And when I reached out to customer service to report this unprofessional behavior, I received a generic, computer-generated response that did nothing to address the issue. Clearly, FlixBus doesn’t care how their customers are treated. |  | I’ve used FlixBus multiple times in the past, but let’s be honest, the only reason I tolerated their poor service was the cheap price. The internet never works, the toilets are often out of service, and the buses themselves are filthy. I could overlook these things for a budget-friendly trip, but dealing with rude, disrespectful employees is where I draw the line. |  | I’ve deleted the app and will never use FlixBus again. If you’re traveling in Scotland, I highly recommend Ember, which offers a far better and more professional service. Do yourself a favor and avoid FlixBus—it’s simply not worth the trouble."

The bus driver got into an altercation with a passenger and pulled into Reading services at which point Flix Bus did nothing. They didnt send an appropriate bus or driver and after 50 minutes we all had to get back on and drive another 80 minutes to Bristol in that temperature."

Flixbus Global,Driver went the wrong way and no refund given,1,,2024-10-08T13:33:01.000Z,"I took a bus that was meant to be going to NYC from Binghamton, NY. About 45 mins into the trip, I realized that the bus driver was driving in the wrong direction towards Ithaca, NY instead of to NYC. I asked another passenger to speak to the bus driver as I was concerned that I might be on the wrong bus. The bus driver confirmed we were going to NYC and then around ten minutes later, he turned around. Twenty minutes later, he admitted to us he had gone the wrong way. As a result of this error and additional traffic, we didn’t end up arriving in NYC until 4:15pm, over two hours later than our original arrival time of 1:55pm. I had a train connection I had to run to catch, and the only reason I was able to make it was because my train was delayed. I was so distressed that I briefly got on the wrong train to Illinois when I was meant to be going to Washington D.C. I understand that issues such as traffic cannot be controlled, but I felt I deserved some compensation for the very stressful journey brought about by an error on behalf of the bus driver. I just don’t understand how he could have gone completely in the wrong direction. When I contacted FlixBus with the details of the case, they said: “Please be assured that we have checked your case, and after careful verification, we saw that the passengers registered on the ticket have been checked in therefore we are unable to offer you compensation in this case.” Clearly they don’t care about their customers."
Flixbus Global,I would give no no stars if possible,1,,2024-10-08T13:33:22.000Z,I would give zero stars if possible. | We arrived at Prague station 25 mins before bus was due to leave. 20 mins to go and we get a text saying bus cancelled.

A couple of weeks later Flixbus took it upon themselves to cancel both tickets and re-issue a new booking with just 1 seat. I then thought I would check out of interest if I could book the seat they had cancelled, and yes I could but at twice the original price when I first booked it. Terrible business practice in my opinion. They issued a voucher which I will never use as I wouldn't ever travel with this company again!"

Flixbus Global,Do not travel with flixbus,1,,2024-10-08T10:01:31.000Z,Do not travel with flixbus! This was by far the worst bus ride I've ever been on! I was assigned seat 20D on bus 403 from Verona Porta Nuova to Ljubljana and it turned out that there was another person also booked in that seat. The driver told me to sit in another seat that was free and so I did. Later another passenger came in and said that I was in her seat and started screaming at me and calling me all sorts of names! This is totally unacceptable! I paid to get from Italy to Slovenia not to play musical chair when a new passenger comes in and to be harassed! I had to spend over 5 hours listening to that other passenger screaming at me because I was now in her seat when I was supposed to be assigned a proper seat! I've been trying to get a refund from flixbus but they are refusing to refund me. Flixbus made the mistake of booking several people in one seat but they refuse to take any responsibility!! What kind of company are you running?? Do not travel with flixbus! | Edit to add: They sent me an email admitting that they assigned several people the same seat and yet refused to refund me! Avoid this company at all costs!

The bus driver did not really care whether we were on the bus or not and definitely did not help us put our bags underneath the bus, but the kicker was that my seat number of 14 D did not even exist on the bus, so I had to go find a seat elsewhere what’s the point of booking the seat you book does not even exist on the bus"

We left the station right on schedule and arrived at our destination 10 minutes ahead of schedule. Smooth driving and comfortable seats. | Only advice I could give is maybe better cleaning of the toilets, there was a bit of smell around the seats close to it. Also higher footrest for short people would be more comfortable. Otherwise perfect. | Edit: great customer service. Rapid response, gracious accepting of constructive criticism and care for details. I have to underline that I do recommend Flixbus for all your travels :D"

Flixbus Global,The worst experience,1,,2024-10-07T01:45:02.000Z,"As I was planning the trip from Zadar to Dubrovnik, Croatia, I had to rely on reviews from other travelers as I had never used bus services overseas (I live in NY, USA). The most important or me was that I can make reservations. I booked two tickets for Friday, 27 Sep. 2024 at 5:30 am from Zadar to Dubrovnik, with transfer in Split. | After boarding in Zadar, (Route N896 Flix Bus Direction Split) I felt there was no reason to worry. It went smooth, the driver was as courteous as it can be, drive fast and comfortable. | But, all that changed in Split at the transfer First, at the ticket shelter they give us wrong platform number. When we noticed the bus is not showing up, we start checking other platforms, and yes, we found the bus for Dubrovnik. The driver was standing in front of the entrance door to the bus, scanning passengers' tickets. Upon entering the bus, we noticed that our seats were taken, and the people did not respond to our comment that those seats were reserved. We went out to ask the driver to help us with seat reservation. He responded: “Complain to the company! I do not care if you are coming with me or not.” Whatever I said, “fell on deaf ears”. I was completely ignored. He left, without any care in the world. I never ever thought it would even be possible for something like that to happen. Needless to say, I was furious. My trip was ruined. | What I do not understand is how hard is to put a note on reserved seats so that people boarding up the bus can see the seats are left for someone who paid extra ticket for sitting there, especially when the bus is empty, just starting its route."

There was no Customer Service number to call, only a help menu on the Flixbus website. When the bus arrived, the garbage from the prior trip was still on the bus.

The only kind of refund we can get is a voucher which has to be used within 12 months. I won’t need to use that bus again so I will lose all of my money. There is nothing right up to payment to tell you you can only get a voucher payment. And you are on a timer to pay or you lose the booking. So you are forced to put all the information in quickly which doesn’t allow you to check your rights with the company. It’s all missold, when I called and asked to speak to a manager they refuse to put you through. They can call their manager but the manager will not speak to the customer.

Flixbus Global,My experience on FlixBus was horrible,1,,2024-10-02T15:56:33.000Z,"My experience on FlixBus was horrible. The bus driver refused to wait one minute for my son even though she already scanned our tickets.

In addition, FlixBus refuses to give me a refund for the bus trip we were not allowed to board."
Flixbus Global,Krakow good experience,5,,2024-10-02T12:50:31.000Z,"I departed (and arrived, in previous) from Krakow. The place is useful and just comfortble as for close located to the railway station, big shopping gallery, and comfortable enough free places to wait downstairs, including toilets and baggage rooms closed at 21.30. The one problem is the closed right elevator at the evening, and absence of Flixbus pointers to find way from there upstair to bus platform. Tired of answers policeman helped me to find right way)) The Flix app informed about estimated time of bus retardation. The driving was comfortable to slumber. The border crossing was quick and comfortable."

Flixbus Global,Shamani - Nice (France),1,,2024-10-01T18:30:23.000Z,"Shamani - Nice, the trip was a couple of months ago. The trip started at about 20:00, we didn't manage to drive 50 km before the bus broke down, we waited for more than 6 hours from 20:30 to 3:30 in the morning. In the end, we arrived in Lyon only at 5:30. |  | And this impudent company only charged me half the cost of the tickets, arguing that we had registered for the flight from Shamani (Mont Blanc) to Lyon. Because of you, I waited at the gas station for almost 7 hours. Should I pay for this? I don't think so. |  | Moreover, the EU law clearly states that a full refund must be made for a delay of more than 2 hours. |  | I do not recommend this terrible service to anyone! I hope they go bankrupt in the near future!"

Flixbus Global,Not recommended,1,,2024-10-01T14:58:36.000Z,Not recommended. The flixbus september 30 3 pm driver was rude and unprofessional. He asked our friends with tho kids to alight the bus just a minute before departure. He initially agreed that booster is okay. His expressions and hand gestures were so rude to them when he was asking them to unboard the bus. 100% a very unpleasant experience especially for the kids. Not recommended at all.

It instead stopped across and up the road (a six lane highway), making it impossible for me to get there before it drove off. When I chased the bus several hundred meters to a red light l, I knocked on the door and the bus driver rudely waved his finger at me and did not open the door."
Flixbus Global,Disgusting Flixbus To Travel In India,1,,2024-10-01T13:04:39.000Z,"Mr. Surya Khurana (Director India) |  | FlixBus.in is having a very bad Cs team they don’t even make the conversation to complete and end the chat by whatever they wanna tell and they don’t listern to the customers at all. |  | Cs team members: Manprit & Sweta are very disgusting and waste of providing them salaries. |  | And this FlixBus.in is scamming me they are not providing my compensation which I am eligible for. They said they have sent a prior notification at 6pm on 20/09/24 but I haven’t not received any notification regarding that boarding point change. I have requested them to send me the proof of notification but they can’t do that. I have clearly received the notification on WhatsApp states that the bus is on time and at the same boarding point at 8pm on 20/09/24. Even I have shared them with the snapshot of that notification along with the time. But concerned department is not responding to it and not providing me any resolution for this. |  | I am emailing them since last 9 days but no response I am getting, even I have added Mr. Surya Khurana Director of flixbus india in the Cc but I think he is not having any concern about the passengers who travelled. That’s the reason I am not receiving the fast responses on my emails. |  | I request Indian passenger’s to not travel on Flixbus at any cost they don’t give proper response when you need them and they don’t have a calling number and WhatsApp chat services is waste of time."

Flixbus Global,windshield broken and angry driver,1,,2024-10-01T05:38:34.000Z,The windshield of the bus had multiple long cracks. We lived in fear that the hole window won‘t break into our faces. The sound of the windshield an Bus was so annoying and loud that you couldn‘t even listen to music on your headphones. You couldn‘t sleep any second. The whole bus stinks like fish. The bus driver sreams at the passengers and drives reckless. He was switching lanes like he was driving go-kart. | It was the most awful bus drive in my entire life! 0/10 would never recommend.
Flixbus Global,Traveling from Europe (Germany) to USA (NY City),2,,2024-10-02T10:43:53.000Z,"My traveling bag was missing upon arrival to the final destination, 28 Allen St, NY, NY 10002 from Bethesda, MD. As a passenger of Flixbus even in Europe, should it not be shocking to have such a devastating experience ??And the customer service has no clue of their corporate address in the USA. No business could operate without a government business permit. Therefore, it has people and places involved. Could the driver pay attention not only to passengers with tickets but to safe guard the luggages? There must be a way/system to prevent from losing or missing or stealing personal property like passengers whose drop off are the same, their luggage’s should be placed in one compartment. The trip clearly indicated only one drop of, Allen. But it did in Midtown, leaving only 3 passengers in Allen. The Driver who gave his name, called out when stopping in Delaware. A call out, a warning to remaining passengers to take their luggages inside would be helpful when drop of in Midtown. This case remains unresolved so it should stay opened. My trip was paid, not a hitch ride. Passengers trusted FlixBus so do I. The company has passengers’ email addresses and could reach out to each one. I have my name and address inside my bag."
Flixbus Global,They use another bus,4,,2024-10-01T03:50:30.000Z,They use another bus. IT looked like a old greyhound bus. No room on the bus. Was not happy. Ecellent bus driver. It wa raining and a lot of traffic

One day before my travel I realized that I click on the wrong stop and my schedule will stop at the station instead of the airport. I try to find a number, and I found some representative via Chat, explaining my situation, the answer was that I have to cancel my trip, with a $45 charge (almost the $60 that I pay at the beginning) to reschedule… I know that was my mistake, but I was using same bus, same day, same route and the price for the other stop was the same. I would understand if the bus was full, but there tons of space and was cero help from you. Without that, the driver Steve was awesome!"

I’m gonna make everyone laugh my first trip I didn’t know where the station was so when we found it the driver had already pulled off and couldn’t stop to let me on so my cousin drove me to Barstow to get on the bus and we beat the bus there due to A Accident. So when the driver got there I told him you thought you where gonna leave me he said no ma’am we’re not leaving until 4 p.m. I told him no you did leave me he replied oh wow that was you in San Bernardino I said yes sir and we both just fell out rolling and when I tell you he was a great driver we got to Vegas early

Flixbus Global,Wouldn't recommend unless your prepared to pay twice.,1,,2024-09-30T16:40:38.000Z,"The problem with flixbus is they are not flexible. They will KEEP YOUR MONEY if your flight or train is running late. If you miss the the bus for ANY reason, they WILL NOT get you on the next bus, they will not credit you a ride, they will keep your money and expect you to pay again(at an even higher price because now its last minute). Consider this when choosing which company you want to work with to get you to your destination."

Despite having a valid ticket and arriving at the departure point well before the scheduled time, the driver denied boarding and refused to let me take the trip. |  | To make matters worse, the driver addressed me and other passengers informally, hurled insults, and even physically pushed a fellow passenger out of the bus. |  | This ordeal forced me to purchase another ticket, causing me to lose my money, and time and undergo severe stress. |  | I firmly believe that individuals who behave in such a manner should be prohibited from working in customer service as well as with clients. |  | Saturday, 21 Sept 2024 | Bus number 2 - DJG - 446, white Mercedes Tourismo | Brussels-North train station - Amsterdam Sloterdijk | 17:00 - 19:45"

But I could not book my ticket online because my credit card was declined, when it should not have been. I then walked 16 blocks to the bus itself because I was hoping the bus driver could book my ticket. I am an 85-year old senior who walks with a cane and has mobility issues -- so you can understand how challenging all this was for me. |  | I then called Chase credit company to figure this out -- which was a 45-minute international call, at my expense, since I had to call from Canada to the United States. Chase told me my credit card was perfectly fine to make charges, but still Flix Bus declined. It was very frustrating. |  | Then, to make matter even worse, a Flixbus representative told me to go to the ""waiting room"" for the 2:15 bus -- when there was no waiting room. Plus the bus driver could not book my ticket for the 2:15pm bus. Please inform your representatives that there is NO WAITING ROOM and to not tell potential customers inaccurate information. |  | Fortunately we found the Red Arrow Bus Company who easily charged my credit card and I was able to get to my destination of Calgary.

Flixbus Global,"perfectly irresponsible, unprofessional, deadly dangerous and unethical business",2,,2024-09-27T09:28:45.000Z,"i wasn't able to buy a ticket online, had to ask a friend to do so through the app. | There is no traveler info AT ALL at Nepliget (HU) station, even though it's a flixbus hub, so you see ""well done"" in sweat people running around to try to find their rides, pulling suitcases behind them in a country where most of the people don't speak EN. Very comforting experience - I went to the international info, but the women there hated her job, so instead of information, I got abused... | shouldn't this company squeeze to the budget having a smiling, EN speaker human being helping the travelers and the drivers where there is a flixbus in every half an hour?! | I had to guard my luggage as other travelers are animals and treat others stuff as crap - I'm expecting flixbus crew does this and not the driver!!! | This driver was OK. | but I also know flixbus is not controlling their subcontractors, so there are many deadly tired drivers (having an 8 hrs shift on public transportation in the morning, then in the evening sitting behind a flixbus wheel for a 15hrs ride, WARNING! digital tachograph cards are not used in public services - those driving hrs are not régistered - so they can easily overdrive and as they are not paid for their jobs, they are forced to do this... | or they just simply didn't sleep last night as their accomodation does not include AC in 40°C Summers... |  | I am a private home cleaner, charging 6000 HUF (15€/hr for my easy peasy, non-responsible for anything, don't have to deal with stoidi, can be late, tired at job, sit down for a coffee or go to the toilet anytime). Hungarian flixbus drivers do not earn half of it for their clearly stressful, dealing with stoidi (on the road and inside the vehicle), being responsible for 49 lifes behind her/him and for the end of the day, yes, bonus is to clean these buses after 15 hrs ride and before another one. Good that their tacho card is out, so the company stays clear as their drivers are already resting... I think police would need to act as this is a crime - risking everyones lives on the road. |  | so basically for these reasons (I've been sitting behind a driver almost falling asleep on the highway on my very first ride with flixbus years ago) I use flixbus, where there is no other chance (HU has been cut from international train rides) and I would notdo any long rides to risk dying on a highway, because some people decide profit is more important than human beings lives. Mine, the drivers are not worth anything, but theirs are so precoius, they can sacrifice us for another Maserati..."

Flixbus Global,This bus trip was a DISASTER,1,,2024-09-30T22:43:16.000Z,"This bus trip was a DISASTER! The bus was 40 minutes late, the driver was nice, but had ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHERE HE WAS GOING. He didn't know how to get to any of the stops, he didn't have a clue what to do at the border. If my wife and I had not taken this bus trip literally hundreds of times over the last 15 years I don't know what would have happened. We had to tell him what to do at the border, where to drive the bus. Literally EVERYTHING.... he didn't know he was supposed to give us forms, he didn't give any instructions to the passengers, and it was clear the majority of them had never taken this trip before (and clearly will not be traveling with FLIX again). My wife gave instructions to all the passengers ( don't get off the bus until the driver tells you to, take everything with you, make sure your forms are filled out, one per household, don't get back on the bus until it pulls forward).... seriously. everything. If this was all that occurred I would place the blame solidly on FLIX..... BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE..... This driver was so distracted it was insane. He almost hit/smashed/sideswiped numerous vehicles. He was swerving all over the place. THIS WAS A HORRIFIC TRIP AND I WANT MY MONEY BACK AT THE VERY LEAST!!!!"
Flixbus Global,Worse customer service,1,,2024-09-26T17:58:06.000Z,Worse customer service. I have Covid and had to change/cancel my tickets. I can’t travel this weekend. I wanted to use the credit to purchase 4 more tickets. They charged me $100 to cancel. Customer service was rude and said that’s our policy deal with it. They only gave me partial credit. They use standard language that is copy and pasted on the chat. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was just blanked out refused and ignored.

No smile. No help with the luggage. While passengers were putting their luggage in the bus, he was eating and smoking, wouldn't help at all. Passengers had to make room and place other people's luggage so they could put their own.Made my whole experience with Flixbus horrible. Isn't it the bus driver's responsibility to see that the bus is clean? That bus was FILTHY. The trays were sooooooo dirty, made my want to vomit, seriously. The driver was asian and the bus's number is 9673. I was gonna ask for identification when we arrived in Toronto , but as soon as the bus stopped, he vanished.

If you're stuck using them because of no other options, here's what to do ( I learned this hard way): |  | * Be vigilant: Keep a close eye on your belongings in the boot, especially at stops. People have language stolen all the time. | * Don't leave the bus: They've been known to leave without passengers. | * Get insurance: Flixbus has a history of technical problems. | * Expect the unexpected: Their drivers can be reckless, and accidents are not uncommon. | * Avoid the restrooms: They're often unusable and disgusting. | * Don't bother with complaints: Their customer service is a joke. |  | I lost my passport and laptop on a Flixbus trip, and the recovery process was a nightmare. I never have had recoveredit. I got automatic AI messages sent instead of any service helping me search for my items. Customer service doesn't exist .Compenstion ? Not a chance.

On Thursday 9/20/2024, I realized I couldn’t make my initial reservation so I tried everything I could to either reschedule or cancel the round trip reservation. On-line was impossible because the chat line simply requested the same information over and over again. I found a phone number and was continually prompted to input my mailbox or access number or some sort of number. After precious moments I had to hang up and start driving to LAX so I wouldn’t miss my red eye flight. Even though I left messages of my situation on line, I wasn’t contacted until Monday concerning my return seating. I’ve requested my refund through the third party who had set up the ticket for me."

That is unexceptionable, and unsafe. I did take pictures. Additionally the wifi didn’t work until they changed drivers. The drivers also had their radio playing the entire time. Bring headphones!!"

The driver informed us that there were no more buses back to London and offered to sell us tickets at an extremely expensive price of 150 euros, claiming it was a discount. He insisted on cash payment and did not provide a receipt or ticket. When I contacted customer service, they were unhelpful and could not assist without a receipt. I was promised an email for an investigation, but I have not received anything yet. Overall, it was a terrible experience with poor customer service. I advise caution when purchasing tickets from drivers and recommend checking the official app for accurate pricing."
Flixbus Global,Terrible Experience with FlixBus – Avoid if Possible,1,,2024-09-24T12:35:57.000Z,"We were scheduled to take the FlixBus from Copenhagen to Odense at 21:20 and arrived 20 minutes early to ensure we had plenty of time. According to the departure board, our bus was supposed to leave from a specific platform, so we waited there. However, to our frustration, the bus ended up being at a completely different location on the large terminal, and we missed it. |  | We had no choice but to purchase new tickets, which were significantly more expensive, though luckily we only had to wait 50 minutes for the next bus. Once again, we carefully followed the instructions on the departure board and waited at the designated platform. But unbelievably, the same thing happened again—the bus did not stop at the indicated platform! Fortunately, we saw it drive by and managed to run and catch it. |  | When we asked the driver why the bus didn’t stop at the assigned platform, he simply said it wasn’t his problem. After this, I contacted FlixBus support to get a refund for the bus we missed, but they replied that since the bus had arrived at the terminal, it wasn’t their responsibility. This is completely unreasonable considering the size of the Copenhagen bus terminal, which is enormous, with buses traveling to destinations all over Europe, including places like Paris and Oslo. How are passengers expected to find their bus if they can’t rely on the platform numbers displayed on the boards and tickets? |  | FlixBus’ customer service was extremely poor, and they refused to take responsibility for the mistake. This was a deeply frustrating and chaotic experience. I will never use FlixBus again and would not recommend them to anyone."

Flixbus Global,Comfortable bus,5,,2024-09-23T12:38:39.000Z,Comfortable bus . Left and arrived on time. Couldn’t get phone charging points to work.
Flixbus Global,"First time with FlixBus, mixed experience",4,,2024-09-23T12:18:26.000Z,"This was my first trip with FlixBus. | First of all, I will take FlixBus again. | The booking process was easy. | The drivers were polite and professional. | The bus left and arrived on time. | I sat by the hot air outlet of the heater and almost burned my feet. I spent the whole trip twisting around in my seat so as not to get too close to the heater. | The USB ports in the bus did not provide enough power to run a cell phone, let alone charge it. However, there was a 230 volt distribution socket by the toilet where you could charge your cell phone. The WiFi connection on the bus was constantly interrupted for me. The toilets in the Paris Bercy bus station were a disaster, some of them closed and queues over 20 meters long. I personally found the seats in this bus uncomfortable and in my opinion the suspension of the chassis was defective. You could feel every pothole. | From Paris Bercy I took a connecting bus from FlixBus. The bus was great and the journey was a good experience overall."
Flixbus Global,The driver is great and actually cares,5,,2024-09-23T12:05:37.000Z,The driver is great and actually cares. He always make the ride enjoyable! The trip going to Houston was great. The ride on the way back to New Orleans was a different experience. The driver on the way back was very rude and condescending. The stars are for the driver from New Orleans to Houston. The driver from Houston to New Orleans gets zero stars.

Flixbus Global,Never Ever Again. Take the train!,1,,2024-09-24T17:12:42.000Z,"I would give zero stars if I could. We arrived at the Bellingham bus stop an hour and a half before our departure time. The bus didn't stop for the 4 of us. I ended up having to drive to Vancouver, Canada. It ended up costing me more than double the bus fare for 4 people to get to Vancouver in time for our cruise. Flix bus response? Too bad. I tried 3 times to cancel return trip to Bellingham over the phone because of no wifi. They didn't cancel. I am out almost $700 for a $160 bus trip. And you cannot talk to a supervisor. They won't speak to lowly customers. | Edit: Their response - no mention of the bus not picking us up. No mention of the fact that I called BEFORE the bus completed the trip to Vancouver. No mention of the fact that I tried A WEEK PRIOR to return trip to Bellingham and trip wasn’t cancelled.

Even their own service cannot help me with rebooking my ticket due to my mistake! I mean, not even the team members—why? I rescheduled my booking, and I understand a few fees have to be taken, but rescheduling it more than 7 days out takes away 50% of your money, and rescheduling it to a new amount is ridiculous. |  | My bad, I didn’t check the rescheduling date properly, and unfortunately, I picked the wrong day. But guess what? To get it corrected, I need to pay for a new seat reservation and cancel the mistaken one. I asked for help, but their assistance team doesn’t have access to change or correct my modified booking mistake. I have no words for this—how can they operate like this?"
Flixbus Global,It was very easy to buy the tickets,5,,2024-09-22T22:29:45.000Z,It was very easy to buy the tickets |  | Thank you
Flixbus Global,Worse customer service and over charged when rescheduled.,1,,2024-09-23T14:01:50.000Z,"When I had to reschedule, I used the company's website to manage my trip plan. The site has some issues and made me repay for the same trip I initially booked. I tried to get help from so-called Customer Support, which never listened to the problem and was adamant that I must pay more ( 3rd time) if I wanted to reschedule. I eventually ended up paying 3x money because I had no other option at that point. |  | Details: | I booked tickets for a route for the 19th of September. Due to some personal issues, I decided I would reschedule and travel on the 20th only(the same time and same route). I called customer service and then used the Flixbus website to manage my travel time as suggested by customer service. During rescheduling, I had chosen 20th September as my new date of traveling, but somehow, I was sent 19th September, the same route ticket in my email. I called customer support back to let them know about the issue. I wanted to get help from them to amend the issue with my ticket so that I can travel on the 20th. They asked me to pay 3rd time and said they couldn't amend the wrong ticket. I already had paid almost the full ticket price to reschedule my ticket ( 51$ original price, then 41 $ to reschedule), and then I was again asked to pay more. | I asked them how the system could send me the same date ticket when I had paid to reschedule and told them that there was some kind of issue with the date selection mechanism on the website. I just wanted them to amend my ticket and no refund or anything. Still, the customer support office did not listen to me, rudely talked to me, and told me that I would have to pay more if I wanted to travel. Having no other option on that day, I paid 41$ more to again reschedule. So eventually I ended up paying ( 51+41+41 + taxes = 137$$). | If a customer can't be helped in such a scenario, why is there customer service at FlixBus? | How can a reschedule option allow you to select the same date /route if it was a user mistake? | Suppose it was a case of user mistake; how can a service take more money to fix the issue? Customer support should be able to fix that internally without charging as the customer already paid double to reschedule."
Flixbus Global,A misleading message has been recieved before the departure,4,,2024-09-22T16:32:44.000Z,"The bus arrived on time both to the place of departuea and arrival. The ride was smooth and comfortable. |  | BUT!!!! About 30 minutes before the scheduled departure we a got a message (SMS and e-mail), that the bus is going to be delayed for about 36 minutes. Ca 5 min before the previously scheduled departure we went to check at the felixbus counter (fortunately we were leaving from a big station, where there was one) only to be told that no, the bus will be on time and we are to hurry to the platforrm.

Flixbus Global,Rude driver and bad service!,1,,2024-09-22T08:09:17.000Z,"We got on the bus from lugano, Switzerland to Milan, Italy. Driver was very very rude. He showed a racist behaviour- was talking nicely to locals and italian speakers but was rude to us, Tourists. The driver doesn’t even know basic English. How can he get the job without basic English? He screamed at us in front of all passengers when we asked him, someone was sitting in our allocated seat. It was very embarrassing. He could say the same thing nicely. I won’t recommend this to any of the tourists."
Flixbus Global,Great service,5,,2024-09-22T07:51:43.000Z,"Overall it's a great service. Tickets are easy to buy, buses are nice and comfortable. On my route the bus was undercooked so we had a plenty of extra room as well. The only complaint I can see was in overall delay of the arrival for up to an hour on 6 hours long trip. But it's hard to say flixbus had anything to do with it. All of the delays were caused by road conditions and by ongoing maintenances which slowed us down quite significantly."

I'm sorry but I will not be using Flixbus again as this is unacceptable. I don't know if it happens very often but once is once too many. Also the bus stop was on the street with no shelter,no seating, no indication for travelers that are not familiar with the area that there is an alternative Transit station (in Windsor) within walking distance (8mins) where you can sit comfortably until it's time for Flixbus to come. It's not mentioned anywhere at the bus stop or on website. | The driver did not even help us to load our luggage or take it off for us until it was very awkward to reach it at the back of luggage compartment, then we got help.Sorry but this is my truthful review"
Flixbus Global,Bus was late,1,,2024-09-22T04:48:27.000Z,Bus was late. No stopping for break. No wifi or points operational for charging phone.

And FlixBus didn’t care or help at all |  | Since then I never traveled with them again | Until two days ago | The bus arrived at least 30 minutes late | The luggage still had no security at all so I had to come down and keep an eye on my bag at every stop | The toilet in the bus was horrible, no toilet paper, no soap, dirty… | And the driving was very uncomfortable. |  | It‘s easy to say FlixBus do not care about their customers, before they were very affordable so you would expect it wouldn’t be the best quality travel, but now they’re both expensive and horrible! What a great deal 😅"
Flixbus Global,pro and cons,3,,2024-09-21T10:58:26.000Z,"** pro | Interesting price for a quite comfortable and ecological ride | ** cons | Buses are often late | for some buses, there is no GPS tracking, so we don't know if the bus is late or very late (quite common) or if the bus left 1 or 2 minutes before the scheduled time (I had this once, very very difficult situation...) | All buses : the forecasted arrival displayed on the App may depend on the decision of the driver to have a 20 minutes break juste before the arrival !"

Flixbus Global,Flixbus didn't even stop and left without us,1,,2024-09-21T08:08:08.000Z,"imagine spending 19 hours on a bus trip to get to your relatives to see them in another country, then the last bus that you need to get on (which is only like 3 hours away from your destination) goes past you, ignoring you completely, while also being 30 minutes late and the bus driver telling you ""its late"" and going away, leaving you with heavy luggage and your family outside in the evening and no other bus to be available that day? That's exactly what happened to me and my family. I had to chase the bus and wave my hands for them to see me and they just left. No we weren't late, we were waiting for 2 hours on that bus stop for them to not even stop??? how is this normal or humane? we had to pay 170€ for one night in a local hotel because of this, thanks for making me waste money and such treatment. Safe to say you lost a customer, I've been using Flixbus for over 2 years and this has never happened before, and I will make sure will never happen again, because I'm not using Flixbus again. I hope the drivers are at least ashamed. The route was 036 from Karlsruhe to Saarbrucken at 17:45, operated by Flixbus DACH GmbH, oh and I also paid extra 15€ for the panoramic seats.. disgusting behavior."

Flixbus Global,We were travelling from Lisbon to Porto…,2,,2024-09-20T23:00:16.000Z,"We were travelling from Lisbon to Porto when the wildfires occurred in Aveiro. While we understand that this was a very serious, and dangerous event - the bus driver did not communicate any information or updates to ease the stressful situation. It was up to passengers to determine alternative arrangements. Once trains were approved to return to service, passengers were left to make decisions about whether to remain with the bus or pay a little extra to train it to Porto. We were fortunate to meet a few people that spoke Portuguese and were able to translate to English, what options might work for us. The bus driver did not relay any information directly or remain on the bus to assure people. Company should have better communication services available for emergency conditions. Flixbus did send out an email the following day, to offer a 10% discount on future trips, but for many of us... there would not be an opportunity to use it, as we had flights heading home."

They felt that they are driving dangerous (like drunk) | Sorry, but I will never use your busses from this area in the world:( |  | Regards, |  | Ivelina Georgieva | Sent from my iPhone"

Flixbus Global,Trip takes far longer than 2 hours,1,,2024-09-24T11:44:24.000Z,"The trip takes far longer than the 2 hours that they claim when purchasing the ticket. Our trip took 7 hours due to the time it took to go through two border check points. First while leaving Croatia and again to enter Montenegro. There should be a warning on the bus route that explains that the border crossing can delay the trip for many, many hours. In our case, the trip took 3.5 times longer than the claimed trip duration."
Flixbus Global,The pick up spot for Wasaga Beach,1,,2024-09-23T14:53:07.000Z,"The pick up spot for Wasaga Beach, Ontario is listed on the wrong side of the road. I was already on the bus and saw the people there and asked the driver to wait. The driver refused to wait one minute for them to cross the road, and seemed to enjoy leaving them there. When I asked him why he did this, he said he had been leaving people there for three months because Flix doesn’t care to fix the information on their website so why should he care? Shockingly bad service. I found out later that the people he left behind missed their flight as they didn’t have another way to the airport. |  | I have just read your reply that passengers are being picked up from the stop mentioned. This is not true - if they catch the bus going from Wasaga to Toronto, it is because a driver waited for them to cross the busy road, which my driver did not. Flix has listed the bus stop as being at the Esso station, which is the wrong side of a very busy road. |  | Flix, your response was unsatisfactory - instead of writing a lie as a response, please reply that you have fixed the pick up point listed on your website for Wasaga Beach going towards Toronto Airport! It should say that the stop is actually on the Superstore side of the road. This is the only confusing part. |  | It can’t be hard for you to fix this so other people do not miss the bus ride they have paid for and are counting on to get to the airport! |  | I will check the website and hope to see you fix it soon."
Flixbus Global,cool and smooth drive,5,,2024-09-18T14:41:21.000Z,"Flixbus is really helpful here in Canada, especially we living in Hamilton Ontario, if not to commute to some certain places like,from Hamilton to London,kitchener and Windsor should have been a big problem and huge waste of money for people without vehicle."

We took a different coach for the return trip to Memmingen. Although the coach was five minutes late, we still enjoyed our trip back home. |  | As for the facilities, there were clean toilets in both coaches, and the seats were comfortable. |  | Flixbus is the cheapest option for a daily trip from Memmingen to Munich as local trains are expensive and there may be several stops en route. As a satisfied customer, I highly recommend it."

Flixbus Global,"Rude, unpolite and unprofessional behavior and late arrival",1,,2024-09-18T01:47:38.000Z,"The coach and bus driver and his assistant were extremely unprofessional and rude. There was a delay in arrival as well. Although I had booked extra luggage in the app, they still asked me to pay them cash more. I had no other option to pay them 10 euros. They treat the passengers very badly and misbehave as if they are like carrying slaves. The seat arrangement was messed up and there was no indication label about seat numbers either."
Flixbus Global,The Last Time I'll Ride With Flix,2,,2024-09-18T00:02:00.000Z,"Took a round trip with Flix Bus/Greyhound from Northern California to Southern California. All buses were somewhat late from specified times, and app is not very clear with regards to changes. | I had a transfer at LA Union station and missed my next bus due to incorrect instructions from the app, and instructions from multiple workers at the station. I was forced to find a place to sleep since it was the last bus of the night. The station workers also provided further incorrect information after missing the bus by saying I could rebook with the Flix bus office. I went to the office and they specifically said they don't do that (re-booking). I then had to call their customer service and had 2 agents hang up on me due to technical issues on their end. This meant I had to re-initiate another call. I did get a rebooking after the 3rd call, but this cost me over an hour of nonstop attempts at getting a re-booked ticket. I did finally get home after 24 hours of when the end trip began. |  | Also the wifi onboard is not good enough to do anything meaningful. |  | 2 stars for at least getting me to my destinations eventually."

Flixbus Global,Constructive criticism.,4,,2024-09-17T22:31:08.000Z,"Cleanliness, nice AC, wifi was good, just that many passengers were speaking too loud either on the phone or among themselves, no respect for personal spaces or common quiet environment. Also the tight/small over head compartments needs to be advertised in bigger scale, many passengers came with over size carry on and contributed in delays, and or taking more seating spaces onboard.company should find away to emphasize the carry on policy in advertising and before passenger booking."

And how rude the bus driver was to a passenger. | His No food or drink signs looked like they were homemade. He made me finish my coffee before I got on the bus, but several of us had to!!!

Flixbus Global,Avoid at all costs,1,,2024-09-17T17:07:15.000Z,Appalling service. Booked a coach from Trogir to Split as part of our holiday. Bus never arrived. Tried to arrange refund. Was initially told that the bus had arrived but having waited at the small bus station in Trogir for an hour (with several other passengers also waiting for the bus) there was no way that the bus had pulled up in the station. The app actually showed that the bus was midway between Trogir and Split so it had clearly just driven past. When we got home we tried to arrange the refund to be told they could not offer a refund due to the processing fee (15 euros pp) being higher than the original price. How pathetic. The bus never arrived so surely that should override any extortionate processing fees. I would have given 0 stars for this company if it had been an option. Avoid at all costs.
Flixbus Global,Left stranded in portugal,1,,2024-09-17T16:43:36.000Z,"We stopped at a gas station because the toilets were broken. The bus driver told us 15 minutes before he leaves again. At 14 minutes, we arrive at the bus stop and we see he left without us, with our luggage on board. | We took a 2 hour uber to lagos to catch the bus that cost 350 euros.. we get there on time and the bus driver said “i said 7 minutes”.

Flixbus Global,Poor Customer Service with FlixBus,1,,2024-09-17T13:23:13.000Z,"I recently had a very disappointing experience with FlixBus during my journey from Budva AS to Tirana East Gate Lindor on August 11, 2024. Despite booking through FlixBus, the service was operated by a partner company, Jadran Ekspres Kotor. While the ticket mentioned that the bus wouldn't have FlixBus branding, this does not justify the subpar service provided. |  | I reached out to FlixBus multiple times seeking assistance and resolution for the issues I encountered. However, their response was to redirect me to the partner company, stating that they were not responsible for the journey despite being the contracting party. This refusal to take responsibility and help resolve my issues is not what I expected from a company like FlixBus. |  | Given the lack of support and accountability, I am now left to warn other potential customers. If you are considering using FlixBus for your travels, be aware that they may not assist you in case of any issues during your journey, especially if it's operated by a third party. Unfortunately, my experience with FlixBus has been far from satisfactory, and I hope others will take this into account when choosing their travel provider."

Not everyone had assigned seats so was an absolute nightmare getting everyone on and sat - if your booking do it on the app and make sure you have seats - the toilet was one of the worst experiences of my life!

Flixbus Global,"Good Journey, But Poor Facilities and Wi-Fi.",2,,2024-09-14T10:43:38.000Z,"The Paris to Braunschweig journey was good, but the toilet was not properly maintained. It was defective and did not flush. There was no handwash liquid, and the Wi-Fi speed was poor, making it impossible to watch movies."
Flixbus Global,Affordable but uncomfortable.,2,,2024-09-14T05:38:14.000Z,"I like the easy process of booking, the safety and satisfied with the fare. |  | But, I didn’t like the customer service. E.g. | there was too hot inside the bus but the driver didn’t even bother to lower the heater. Everyone was sweating. We told him but he was telling that he is feeling cold in the front so he can’t. |  | The door of the washroom was faulty, that was opening and closing frequently while the bus was turning right to left and left to right, so the bad smells were coming out of that and spread all around the bus, everyone was uncomfortable with that. |  | The Bus wasn’t on time at London Victoria, it delayed. From a popular brand like flixbus, we as passengers can atleast expect it to be punctual enough. And moreover it dropped us off 45mins delayed as well. |  | Sorry but it may help to improve your service. | Thanks."

Flixbus Global,Absolutely terrible services,1,,2024-09-13T20:49:18.000Z,"Absolutely terrible services. I am never going to book Flixbus ever again. They changed departure location twice, and the departure time from 3:15 to 3:30, 3:45, and finally 3:59. By the time we were at the pickup location (3:46), the bus was already gone! I wrote a complaint to customer service and provided screenshots of the delays and they had the audacity to tell me that the bus schedule was on time!! I called them and they are not even taking the responsibility of the delay! And I was told that I was supposed to be there 15 minutes ahead of the initial departure time (3:15) which is stupid. Why would I go there from 3 pm if you’re telling me that the bus departures at 3:59!!! They didn’t even compensate for my alternative transportation. Irresponsible staff behaviour and irresponsible company!!! Never booking again!"

Flixbus Global,Flixbus left us stranded!,1,,2024-09-13T12:05:54.000Z,"I rarely post negative reviews but I’m very disappointed with Flixbus and will never use them again. |  | I was among a group of 13 passengers left stranded at Niagara Falls bus stop, because the bus we were booked onto came and went without stopping to pick us up. Myself and my husband (and other stranded passengers) had no choice but to go online and buy tickets for the later bus (an extra 50 dollars) back to Toronto, then wait. Just to be clear, we were in the right place at the right time (we were actually at the stop 15 mins early) and even tracking our bus on the app. But we never saw it physically arrive or leave. |  | When I emailed the company, explaining what happened and requesting a refund for those extra tickets, they took almost two weeks to reply, then informed me that while they are very sorry my experience “fell so far short of expectations”, they couldn’t provide a refund as the bus “was operating as scheduled” and did pick up some passengers (just not all!). |  | Won’t be using Flixbus again, that’s for sure. Very poor customer service."

It’s super comfortable, can do whatever I please for 3 hrs. The price is reasonable. The driver is very polite & friendly. Refused to take tip. States “we are not supposed too”.

It was a Flixbus-operated bus, so I immediately submit a lost baggage claim that same night. They even update the system to say they found something that may be my bag. |  | After that point I could get no one to answer whether the bag had been checked, how I could get in contact with the lost and found team, or even a location that lost items are taken to. Forcing customers to resort to police reports and sending them invoices for items rather than returning them is just terrible customer service."

Flixbus Global,Worst Customer Service ever,1,,2024-09-12T13:24:42.000Z,"Customer service can hardly get worse than this. Bus was cancelled and alternative transportation was taken after online customer service promised it would be reimbursed. It took me 8 weeks to get the amount reimbursed after different agents bounced me with the same pre-written answers 10+ times. They kept asking for bank account info + proof of alternative transportation, although those had been provided multiple times since the original contact. Irritating.

Flixbus Global,A DIABOLICAL experience!,1,,2024-09-13T23:24:34.000Z,"Our, that's me, my wife and 6 yr old daughter's journey, was in Turkey, from Goreme to Fethiye, and was meant to take 11 & 1/2 hours; (it actually took 13hrs). | Anyway, I'll TRY to be succinct. I was told that night buses in Turkey were good; this one was NOT! |  | -- No toilet on board; and no English spoken, so VERY difficult to know if one had time to try to find one at one of the 15 or so stops. (It seemed that the bus stopped for as much time as it moved; with the drivers probably having 4 meals!) | -- These 2 drivers were allowed to smoke; so the bus was full of it, which makes me choke. | -- I measured it, and the distance between the front of my single seat and the back of the one in front, was barely 20cm!!-- The smallest I have ever witnessed; even on a bus travelling a short distance, never mind this sort of distance. In fact, so close were the seats, that the lad who worked on the bus doing all the jobs bar the driving, had to ask many of the passengers to raise the backs of them....for the entire journey. | -- The seats themselves were extremely uncomfortable, (not just mine), with metal jabbing into one's back. | -- In fact, there were many things that didn't work on this vehicle that was in very poor repair.....i.e. overhead and floor lighting; fans; the clock at the front etc etc. And obviously there was no wi-fi. |  | Suffice to say that I couldn't get a minute's rest, let alone any sleep; and I never properly recovered for the remainder of the holiday. | My wife had booked this journey; but in future I will be EXTREMELY careful to double-check what has been booked. |  | -------In answer to the answer from Flix, I have tried going to where I was instructed, but it just goes/reverts to flixbus.co.uk, with no sign of any form to fill in?? | And, even if I were ever to come across a form to fill in, what sort of form are you referring to? |  | -------No, I've tried it again tonight and it still doesn't work.

I had a noisy passenger in my back seat who is speaking calls on speaker until like around 2AM in the midnight and I went and asked for change of seat to the driver and he totally avoided and when I asked driver about toilet paper he said we don’t have any. How can you run bus without toilet paper which has over 12hours of travel time.
Flixbus Global,Stuck at night far from home with no recourse and no support,1,,2024-09-12T23:11:12.000Z,"I booked in June and received a ticket by email. Before leaving for my trip last week, I tried to load the ticket in the Flixbus mobile app but it didn't recognize my booking number or email address, so I brought the ticket I'd been emailed in June with me. The departure address on that ticket was no longer valid, but Flixbus hadn't notified me that they'd changed the departure address so I waited 90 minutes in the dark for a bus that didn't come and was stuck in Seattle with my 9 year old disabled child. |  | Followup: I called customer support Monday and they told me that they could see in their computer that I changed my departure location and therefore the problem was my own fault. That makes no sense: not only did I not change anything after booking my ticket, but I have no control over where the bus departs from. |  | Now they are claiming, again with no proof, that I received an SMS about the change. Looking at the Flixbus online booking process, they don't ask for a phone number when selling a ticket—just name and email address—so I'm not sure how they would even have my phone number. While I could've missed a text message, searching my entire message history for the words ""Flixbus,"" ""departure,"" ""station,"" ""Lane"" (the departure address printed on my ticket), and ""Brougham"" (the updated departure address), I find no message from Flixbus."

Take the train and avoid Flixbus. |  | UPDATE: see the reply below from Flixbus. There was no ""resolution"" from Flixbus. Only a ""we're sorry for the inconvenience"". That is NOT any kind of a resolution. It is merely a big company replying with an artificial level of concern.

Flixbus Global,Awful,1,,2024-09-09T04:26:00.000Z,"Awful in Murfreesboro, TN. |  | There are no signs saying the bus stop is where it is. It’s a gravel parking lot. Near a Public Works gas station. The address that Flix Bus gives is 500 W. Main. The only bus stop sign which one would think is for City Bus and is where the gravel parking lot is 546 W. Main. There’s no mention that you’re going to a gravel parking lot. One side of the road the address ends at 517 West Main. The other side of the street starts at 420 West Main. Customer Service is adamant that the address is 500. There is no 500 W. Main. |  | I flagged down a police officer to find out Where the stop is. That is how I learned. It’s the gravel parking lot near the Public Work gas station at 620 W. Main. |  | Customer service would not refund the money nor credit towards another bus ride. They got $100 we got nothing. I booked this for a friend. I drove him there. |  | I called them 6 times. 5 times the calls kept getting disconnected before a human would answer. |  | The customer service rep told me the address is 500 W. Main. When I asked him to describe what the building looks like he couldn’t. He said there’s no way Flix Bus would make a mistake. He also told me that 48 people got on the bus there. Yet, there were no vehicles in the parking lot. Somehow, 48 people all needed and got a ride to THAT stop? (Yah right). |  | SAVE YOUR MONEY. FIND ANOTHER WAY TO GET TO YOUR DESTINATION."

Not only was my trip significantly delayed, but the driver’s behavior was completely unprofessional. He was visibly frustrated due to traffic, cursing throughout the journey, and even entered the bus with a cigarette still lit. This kind of behavior is unacceptable for any transportation service. |  | The customer service response to my complaints was equally frustrating, offering no meaningful solution or compensation for the inconvenience.

The drivers did not care whatsoever and told us we forgot where we left our luggage, etc. We heard from others that this type of thing happens every day. Therefore, we recommend that you watch the luggage compartment of your bus stops between your departure and your destination. We were treated very, very poorly. Thank you."

Another bus arrived 40 minutes later going to our end destination. We asked the driver to let the driver bus 1779, know we are still waiting for the bus to arrive. The bus driver told us the bus had been cancelled, so we asked if we could board his bus. He said he would accommodate us but we had to purchase another ticket to board. We said he is working for Flexibis and knows our situation. That we are basically stranded. He said pay or stay. We all paid online. We all contacted the service support via chat and was told the bus had arrived on time and we all went there. Very disappointing, the rest of my travels in Italy were not booked with Flexibus.

Flixbus Global,Trip from Prague to Valencia,3,,2024-09-20T11:00:47.000Z,"On a trip from Prague to Valencia on September 3rd 2024 at 11:35 PM, the first leg from Prague to Munich went well, except for a man with three women and twenty suitcases, who took up about a third of the luggage space, but otherwise, everything was fine. However, on the bus from Munich to Lyon at 8:45 AM, one of the drivers, a man in his fifties with gray hair and beard, and a sturdy build, treated a young African girl very poorly. She had a medium-sized suitcase but it was overweight. It's true that a suitcase cannot exceed 20 kg, but you can’t say things by shouting and insulting like this driver did. He also took the suitcase, threw it on the ground, and insulted the girl again. There are better ways to say and do things. The bus from Lyon to Valencia at 11:30 PM was half an hour late because both drivers got lost on the way and didn’t know how to get to the bus station. Additionally, there was an incredible lack of organization inside the bus regarding the seats, with everyone sitting wherever they wanted, showing very little professionalism from these two drivers."

Flixbus Global,Extremely bad experience and very rude drivers,1,,2024-09-05T18:51:49.000Z,"While booking seats, was given an option to book seats in the first row with extra payment which we did. When boarded the bus, the driver very rudely and loudly said, ""you cannot sit on these seats as these are reserved for staff"". He continued arguing till we showed him the seat numbers printed on our ticket, and still insisted, it is a mistake by FliXBus, not of the driver. I could not understand his statement as if, he is not an employee of the company? Same thing happened to another passenger in both the up and down journey (Toronto-Niagara-Toronto, 4th September 7:30 AM departure form Union Station, and 6:35 PM departure form Niagara. Internet did not work at all, arm rests and seat belts were not working too. In return journey, bus arrived almost 45 minutes late. But on top of everything, both the drivers were extremely rude and impolite. Especially on Niagara-Toronto sector, he repeatedly shouted on a passenger, and threatened to call Police, instead understanding the issue and deal with it amicably. FlixBus should immediately stop letting passengers to book seats in the first row by paying extra cost to avoid such situations in future. All in all, a very bad experience and I am not going to travel or recommend this company to anyone."

Why should passengers have to endure banging windows for 5 1/2 hours and a driver who doesn't give a damn (or comprehend/speak English?)

Flixbus Global,Flixbus stole my money,2,,2024-09-03T19:44:12.000Z,"Flixbus stole my money. I recently traveled NYC to Niagara Falls on Flixbus and purchased my 4 tickets a couple of months in advance. I was charged extra to reserve seats so we could all sit together. They first switched my bus and put 3 of us together. I tried a few times to reach customer service. They hung up on me or unresponsive in the online chat. So I just paid the extra again to change 1 seat to be with the rest of the group. The day we were set to travel we showed up to the bus stop early like requested and there was 1 person in a vest working there. I asked them about my bus showing them my ticket and they said the bus hadn't showed up yet. So we waited and our departure time came and went. So I talked to different person in a vest working there because the other person had left and they told me the bus number on my ticket was not the right number and our bus had already left! I called customer service and they couldn't confirm my reservation number so they hung up on me. I finally talked to someone and they could not refund my money and they couldn't help me make a new reservation, they didn't do anything to help me. Luckily I was able to pay cash to another driver to hitch a ride. This was my mothers dream to go to Niagara and it was almost ruined by this awful company. I will say the driver was very professional and nice. Once we were on our way everything was okay."

Flixbus Global,Unsafe and Miserable,1,,2024-09-03T16:21:48.000Z,"I’m don’t usually leave negative reviews, but I was particularly alarmed by this trip. | While trying to find my seat, I was verbally harassed by a man towards the back of the bus. He was shouting that I should have arrived earlier if I wanted a specific seat (I was 10 minutes early) and that I needed to “sit the f&@! down”. He then walked up and down the aisle selling water and chargers to people while continuing to shout. He was not a passenger and the driver was watching. So, the driver had not only let a non-passenger on the bus, but did not intervene when the man verbally harassed several passengers. I felt incredibly unsafe. Despite purchasing a seat, I was unable to use it because someone else was in it. She refused to move because her seat had also be taken. It became apparent that most of the passengers had ignored the seat assignments and the driver was unwilling to rectify this. | I grabbed an open seat, though I had to move later because the passenger who was assigned that seat boarded at the next stop. | On top of the boarding and seat chaos, the vent controlling the AC at my seat was broken so I was unable to turn it down. I was freezing. The seat adjustment lever was also broken. Whenever, I leaned back on the seat to relax, it would pop out of place and the seat would jolt backwards. I had to sit sideways after I had to keep fixing the seat. One of the outlets at the seat didn’t work either and the WiFi was very slow. | If it was just the internet and the seat, I probably wouldn’t have said anything. It was a cheap bus ticket after all, but the street vendor on the bus yelling at me was quite scary. And I didn’t get the seat I had paid for. | Also, we were 30 minutes late arriving at our destination and the driver gave no delay warnings or updates. In fact, the only time the driver spoke to us was to announce the stop name. He never gave us a safety briefing or any sort of greeting/explanation."

Flixbus Global,Refund Policy not customer friendly,1,,2024-09-03T14:31:44.000Z,"The customer service rep was not helpful at all. I have 4 little children, got distracted while I was trying to book my ticket, got distracted, I chose Oct 2, 2024 as my traveling date instead of Sept 2, 2024. When I realized it, I canceled my initial ticket and rebooked with the right date of Sept 2. Number 1, I got charged a higher price, number 2, I got charged in USD which made it even worse, the first time I mistakenly booked for Oct 2, my master card was charged in Canadian dollars, but when I canceled and rebooked, I was charged in US dollars, more than double of what I had paid initially. I called and wanted a refund for my first ticked which I had canceled, I was informed that a travel voucher was issued for my next travel, but I do not have plans to travel again anytime soon. I need my money back, times are hard now, especially for a parent with 4 children, you what I mean. Please, I need my 386.95 CAD to be returned to my master card. Besides, they have no wifi in the bus, the bathroom was dirty. Driver kept turning the air conditioner off. It was not a pleasant experience at all."

Flixbus Global,FlixBus - A Disappointing and Stressful Experience,1,,2024-09-01T23:30:26.000Z,"I recently took a round trip with FlixBus from Toronto Union Station to Parry Sound, and it was an experience I wouldn’t want anyone else to go through. Here’s why: |  | Disgusting Toilets: The toilets on both trips were in a deplorable state. It was so bad that I had to avoid using them entirely, which made the long journey even more uncomfortable. |  | Chaos with Seating and Boarding: Despite having reserved seats, passengers were boarding and taking seats at random stops, with no regard for reservations. An elderly couple couldn’t find proper seating, and there was no staff to help organize the situation. |  | Lack of Signage and Disorganization: The FlixBus app pointed out where the pick-up would be, but there was no signage at the location. Passengers were scattered, confused, and the bus was delayed both times. We even had to rely on a competing bus company’s driver to tell us where to wait! |  | Unacceptable Driver Behavior: The worst part of the trip was the driver’s attitude on our return journey. My 8-year-old son started feeling unwell, so we decided to get off one stop earlier at Pearson Airport. When we politely asked the driver to retrieve our luggage, he became hostile, raised his voice, and even made sarcastic remarks. It was embarrassing, distressing, and completely uncalled for, especially in front of my child and the other passengers. |  | I understand that FlixBus is a low-cost service, but that doesn’t excuse the poor treatment of passengers. From the lack of basic hygiene to the aggressive behavior of the driver, this trip was a disaster. I won’t be using FlixBus again and strongly advise others to consider alternative options. No one should have to experience what my family and I went through."

No real issues with the actual journey, driver was bubbly and we even stopped for 15-20 min toilet breaks etc. | Quality of the bus wasn’t too bad only downside is there are no charging ports where you sit, only in little area of the bus by the stairs but that’s no drama. | We were a bit late to the final destination but that was due to delays at Dover. | Can’t complain"
Flixbus Global,"Good alternative for train, but watch the luggage policy",4,,2024-09-01T20:17:05.000Z,"The bus was comfortable and clean, it was quiet, the driver drove carefully, the ride was on time. Thank you. | However, the charges for addl luggage like a small suitcase that is allowed on aircrafts as carry-on are steep, almost as much as the ticket itself. And then the bus co-driver initially tried to block us from loading them, saying there was not enough room. Complete baloney—there was plenty of room and we had paid for everything. Only after the bus driver scanned our ticket did he relent. It was an uncomfortable moment."

Flixbus Global,AVOID,1,,2024-09-02T13:59:23.000Z,"AVOID: I purchased a ticket to travel from Heathrow to Gatwick. The bus was delayed by at least 30 minutes, forcing me to purchase another ticket from a different company to ensure I would arrive on time for my flight. The company's bus schedule is not reliable, and there is a risk of missing your flight. It's important to note that they do not offer refunds if the bus is delayed by less than 2 hours, resulting in a loss of £12 for me. |  | FYI Flixbus answered my review, and this is my answer to it!, | #I realized that you cannot offer anything. The overall service of Flixbus at the airport is hideous because there are not many services available if one bus is late. If your bus is late and the estimated time of arrival is not accurate, anyone could miss a flight. If your bus is later than 120 minutes you can offer a refund, but if that was the case, it would be a disaster for your customers as 100% of them would have missed their flights!! | Your whole system is disgraceful.

We and some other passengers tried to get on the bus which we thought was the one we need but the driver didn't let us in stating that it's different route, thus the bus left without us and we had to by a new ticket and wait again for 1.5 hours. I requested a full refund of the first ticket and they refused saying that it is not their fault. I lost money and precious time and FlixBus lost at least two clients forever.

Flixbus Global,This is the worst service provider,1,,2024-08-31T00:49:30.000Z,This is the worst service provider. I once booked ticket from Lafayette to Chicago the bus got delayed by 1 and half hours. I do not recommend this.
Flixbus Global,If I could give zero stars I would,1,,2024-08-31T00:02:04.000Z,"If I could give zero stars I would! The bus never showed up... I was at the bus stop thirty minutes before the original bus departure time, which was then delayed and I just sat there for another forty minutes (twenty minutes past the delayed time) and the bus never showed up. The tracking app showed the bus had not even come to the bus stop. Someone has to drive all the way from Los Angeles to come pick me up around midnight in Santa Barbara just to turn around and drive back to Los Angeles.... almost four hours of driving and ten gallons of gas, so $50 on top of the useless ticket I payed for. And ""customer service"" told me it was not their responsibility and could not help me, just that I should call the bus company that THEY contracted. Horrible experience. Unless they can manage to make this right I will never use them again, nor will any of my friends or family."
Flixbus Global,Great process,5,,2024-08-30T23:43:30.000Z,Great process
Flixbus Global,Refused refund,1,,2024-08-30T22:17:40.000Z,"I purchased a ticket from Toronto airport to London. My ticket was for 1230. The bus stop is at pillar 4. I arrived at pillar 4 at 12. I waited patiently for my bus. It never arrived at pillar 4. I missed my bus because it stopped at pillar 2 and didn't announce that it was my bus. Not only that, it wasn't even a flixbus. It was a partnership bus. The only reason I realized I missed the bus was because when the other bus took off it drive past me and it had a tiny little sticker on the side that said it was a flixbus partner. |  | I purchased a second ticket for the same location for 3 hours later that evening. I called the customer support and they ""reviewed"" my situation and refused to refund me for my previous ticket. This was my first time using flixbus, at an airport I've never been to and nowhere on the site does it explain that some of their buses are not the big green flixbus. They are partner buses with totally different company names and teeny tiny little stickers that say flixbus. And they don't announce anything, and they stop at different spots other than where they say."

Because I didn’t have Wi-Fi at the moment, I needed to get it from the bus I couldn’t show him my ticket. He said that’s not my problem. I knew All he had to do was look up my name on his phone, but he wouldn’t do it until the last minute when I thought the bus was gonna leave without me."
Flixbus Global,Will never ride again! …,1,,2024-08-30T11:47:51.000Z,"This was my first time riding Flexibus since this was the only transportation to Newark Airport at the time I needed. Ineffective communication from the bus driver, rude, didn’t enforce seat reservations, paid for a seat and still had to sit with someone else. I get on the bus and the seat was hard to find and someone else was sitting in my seat and didn’t want to move. WiFi didn’t work, no restroom on board or no plugs to charge phone. Just overall a bad experience. Never again."

Flixbus Global,"Rude, unhelpful, will create trouble and leave you at it",1,,2024-09-02T11:15:02.000Z,"I would like to be constructive, but you will not find anything constructive in this review. I sincerely hope FlixBus will go bankrupt, but considering how much money they stole from me with their incompetence and negligence, probably that won't happen soon. | I bought 4 tickets for my family to get from Krakow back home. Ticket said the bus might arrive to a number of platforms, so follow information at bus station, which I did. | But guess what, the bus driver, bus station personnel and FlixBus staff didn't care about getting the bus to the correct platform. Any boarding platform will do in their opinion. So I missed the bus, because THE BUS was at wrong platform (obviously at the ""first platform"", but there is no such thing as 1st platform or platform 1 at Krakow bus station) and was not marked with either starting point of my itinerary not the end of my itinerary. | Later, when I finally managed to find customer support number and called, I was made aware, that it is my fault that I didn't know that bus is ""always at first platform"" (meaning in this case ""we misinform every second traveller about boarding point"") and I should have checked other places and busses to find my bus. To be clear - about 0.5% of the staff speaks anything but Polish, good luck finding anything. | So I had to purchase another tickets because I couldn't really wander around city at night finding hotel with ton of luggage and 2 small children. | While boarding on that second bus, which arrived 5 minutes before departure (instead of 15-20) I POLITELY asked why is the bus at wrong platform (yes, it arrived again to the wrong platform) and got yelled at by the driver instead of any meaningful reply. Then driver yelled at my wife, at my children and continued to talk to me in high tone until I started filming him. | Basically I'd give about -55 stars if I could. | So if you use the FlixBus and they mix things up (you know what I wanted to write, a bit different expression), which they probably will do, it will be your fault, you will be yelled at and called an idiot. |  | UPD 02.09.2024 | Got the e-mail from FlixBus, full quote below. |  | ""Hello Konstantin, |  | We hope this email finds you well. |  | We are contacting you regarding your review on the TrustPilot platform. |  | Please accept our heartfelt apologies for any inconvenience or discomfort you experienced during your trip. |  | As we can see, the ride was on time. As per our terms and conditions, unfortunately no refund is possible in this case. Furthermore, other passengers have boarded on time at the same stop as indicated on your ticket. |  | Please note that, as per our T&Cs: ""The reimbursement can be requested for reasons which are the responsibility of FlixBus such as delay >120 minutes and the passenger withdraws from the trip, cancellations, which means that only in such cases the refund can be claimed."" Please note that rescheduling the ticket is also not possible. |  | Based on our Terms and Conditions, we cannot offer you a refund of your ticket once the ride has taken place. |  | Please check the information on this link, as per our T&C, which states: | 13.2.5 A refund will not be given if the passenger did not travel or the seat was allocated or purchased free of charge. |  | You can find the policy here: --here was a link to policy-- |  | For future reference, please keep in mind that you can change or cancel the ride details up to 15 minutes before departure via Manage My Booking. |  | We regret we cannot meet your request this time. |  | We would appreciate the opportunity to convince you of our reliability and therefore hope to have you aboard. |  | Kind Regards, | Leonita from FlixBus"" |  | I have a few comments to this load on BS. | I have NO IDEA if the bus was on time or not, because it NEVER ARRIVED AT THE CORRECT PLACE. To board the bus you must not only be on time, but also AT THE CORRECT MEETING POINT. I was on time and at ANNOUNCED, as you mentioned in your ticket (quote: ""Please pay attention to station statements.""), boarding point. | And you failed, miserably, to get your part of the service - get the bus to the ANNOUNCED point, as agreed in terms of service (the ticket). | Can you imagine this at an airport or train station? Maybe in Africa, not EU. | 2. ""Other passengers"" argument is so weak for a number of reasons. A. I don't know if there were any. B. Even if they were, they might have prior experience of such misbehavior. C. It does not change THE AGREEMENT with me, personally, to be at certain point at certain time. | When I asked customer support ""What platform was announced"" I got answer, that ""the bus is riding and i can give you it's location"" - not answering my question, don't you think? And to the question ""What platform did the bus go to?"" I got the answer ""It's always first platform"", when i inquired ""How is this first platform marked?"" I got the answer, that ""the bus is riding and i can give you it's location""."
Flixbus Global,A kind driver …,5,,2024-08-29T07:58:10.000Z,The email for the ticket had not loaded by the time I got on the bus. So I was ready to get off the bus and then learned I could pay cash. However the driver had such grace. He suggested I take a seat and that I could figure it out before the next stop. And this is what worked and I located the ticket.

The second leg however (Zagreb-Split) was a big let down. The bus was not up to standard. The front upstairs window screen was cracked from top to bottom. In London this vehicle would not be allowed on the road in public service. On the positive side, the driver drove with care. I have another FlixBus service booked soon, so hopefully this was a one-off."

All other drivers refused to take because I was not meant to come off at Lille. So didn't have a connecting ticket from London Victoria-Lille- Brussels Gare du North. Don't understand why I was asked to come off in the first place. | Eventually got there. On my return on 26th August, bus delayed for 25 minutes. Instead of 23:35 bus came at 00:00. Got to Victoria at 10:15, missed connecting bus 9:15 to Reading. Was told next bus will be 2pm. No apologies for either of the drivers for outbound nor customer service staff. Very rude staff. Had to wait at Victoria from 10:30, was told 2pm, then later told next bus will be 7:30 pm to get to Reading. That's if the bus for Reading comes on time. | Will never recommend such a service to anyone, not even my my dog. Such a useless service. No respect not regard for customers. Extremely appalling bus service. No one should ever waste their precious time taking Flix bus. I will be on social media to share my experience. Horrible experience, disgusting customer service. Was even trying to for assistance to customer rep, who stumped off because another passer was trying to get some information. | Utterly disgusting service. I regret using it. Ended up finding my way home by buying ticket with National Express, rather travelling all night and getting to Victoria at 10:15am and be told, I 've missed connecting bus, becuase we left Brussels late and next bus is 7:30pm. | Thank God, I got home safe and sound."

Company doesn't seem to calculate Mariners' game day traffic. Trip took 4.5 hours, train beat us into the Portland station. Newer driver (I can understand why they're quitting) went to Departures at Sea-Tac instead of Arrivals. No app or company employee notified of a driver not picking up a dozen people last Friday. By now we're running an hour late. Toured Tacoma and Olympia trying to find the stops. Glitches with the ticketing process for several riders, which caused more delays. Now we're 1.5 hours late. Arrived in Portland at 10:00 p.m. The train arrived before us. Bus hadn't been cleaned. Litter shoved into crevices. There was a sharp metal lever (broken seat adjuster?) jammed into my thigh. Unable to sleep with the discomfort. No sign of chargers; air vents didn't work; upholstery stained, and I don't want to think what that bathroom looked like.

Flixbus Global,Horrible Experience from Start to Finish,1,,2024-08-26T19:31:42.000Z,"I had a terrible experience with Flixbus on my trip from Nice to Barcelona. My seats were changed without explanation or refund, and the trip was canceled with no option to reschedule. Flixbus rebooked us for the next day without asking, and reaching customer service was nearly impossible. When we finally boarded, the bus smelled awful due to a broken toilet, and the drivers couldn't communicate in English or French. The bus then broke down, causing a 4-hour delay and missed events. This was an unacceptable experience."
Flixbus Global,Several options and very attractive prices,5,,2024-08-26T18:44:39.000Z,"Several options and perfect for long distances in a very attractive price. I use flixbus for more than 5 years already and now with them in Portugal, there are lots of good options."

Overall, it was a very uncomfortable trip."
Flixbus Global,Absolutely disgraceful customer service…,1,,2024-08-26T17:03:08.000Z,"Absolutely terrible customer service again and again throughout Europe. They tried to not let me on the bus because they messed up with their bike carrier, and tried to blame it on me. Fortunately this time I stood my ground, because when they make a mistake they will try everything to screw you and leave you at the side of the road and make you feel like a piece of !?£&. Unbelievable"
Flixbus Global,Stolen Luggage,1,,2024-08-27T12:42:04.000Z,"While traveling with Flix Bus I must say was very convenient to go from Fort Myers, FL. to Fort Lauderdale,FL. But please watch your luggage if going on a vacation. We were told by the driver to just leave our luggage by the middle Bin of the bus and they would load the luggage for us. We did as we were told and proceeded to the sit in our seats. When we arrived in Fort Lauderdale to go on a cruise there was no luggage, it never made it on the bus it was stolen from Edison Mall where we met the bus. Now when we got back from our cruise please remember all we had was what we were wearing which was shorts and a tee shirt, Flix bus wouldn't even talk to us. So please don't let this happen to you watch your possessions at all times. I would also like to add that my friend and I are Senior Citizens (81 and 86), I have to ask would you still go on a 4 day cruise with one pair of shorts and a tee shirt?????"

What made the situation even more appalling was when he threatened to kick us off the bus, including my one-year-old child, creating an incredibly hostile and unsafe environment. |  | Such behavior is not only unprofessional and discriminatory but also a clear violation of basic human rights. I am deeply concerned about the well-being and safety of my family during what should have been a simple journey. |  | Given the seriousness of this incident, I am currently exploring my legal options, including filing a formal complaint with the Canada Human Rights Commission. |  | I urge you to investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate action against the driver involved. I also expect a written response outlining the steps Flexi Bus will take to address this issue and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. |  | I look forward to your prompt response and resolution of this matter."
Flixbus Global,Great company!,5,,2024-08-26T06:18:43.000Z,"The app is intuitive, the staff is friendly, and it was an all around great experience. The only thing I would fix is adding an option to change route incase there is a different stop in a city that you rather go to."
Flixbus Global,I booked an unaccompanied minor ticket…,1,,2024-08-28T13:22:46.000Z,"I booked an unaccompanied minor ticket for my 12 year old as I have done numerous other times. His dad lives in red deer and I live in Edmonton and it’s easier and cheaper and safer to put him on the bus. When my ex went to put him on the bus, the driver scanned his ticket (so it shows he was on the bus) but then refused to let him on since he wasn’t 16. However, the ticket showed he was an unaccompanied minor travelling alone. I then had to drive and get my son. |  | I just see that FlixBus replied stating that they did what was allowed, however on their website it states that children between the ages of 10-15 can travel alone with permission from the parent (that you click when you book the ticket). Therefore, he should have been let onto | The bus as he had the correct ticket and the allowed permission to travel."

E' un autobus da pietra ligure a Torino, di ritorno dalla vacanza e con la necessità di DOVERE LAVORARE DOMATTINA. Abbiamo dovuto pagarci la notte in albergo, e il treno alle 635 per poter essere a Torino alle 10 con notevole ritardo. NON PRENDEREMO MAI PIU' QUESTA COMPAGNIA CHE DOVREBBE CAMBIARE LAVORO!!! E' INCREDIBILE . |  | You should take care of people instead of throwing them on the street at night, with no chances to get a new bus or having a place to sleep. You cannot cancel a bus 10 minutes before it should pass by and shake your hands! I don't care about 25 euro, the refund is ridiculous. | When airlines cancel a flight, they take care of the passengers and offer food and accommodation. | You left people stranded in the evening, with no possibility of finding a solution. What do you think a person did????"
Flixbus Global,Overall good service.,5,,2024-08-25T18:44:13.000Z,"Great option for transportation from one place to the other. Needs more attention on luggage management and informing their customers where they are, some drivers do some don’t. But overall this is a great service."

But it does not. |  | It's been almost a week now so maybe just admit my luggage is nowhere to be found which is in line with what the driver told me. That your own employees will steal it.

Flixbus Global,I do not appreciate the experience,1,,2024-08-28T19:44:56.000Z,"Yes, there is a ""Terms and Condition"" that everyone has to consider when it comes to choosing FlixBus. I chose Flixbus because 1. Due to limit income for travel 2. There is also limit choices in order to go from KY to OH. However, despite there is a fact there is ""Terms and Conditions"", I do not apologize for the choices I made. Thanks to this experience, it has opened my eyes over how a company like this runs and treats their customers (or passengers). This is something I hope that anyone who reads this can learn from as well. Since I agreed with the ""Terms and Conditions"", I will have to accept that I will not ever receive my nearly $100 back (nonrefundable), and various people who work for and/or with the company their ""policies"" or actions as well. I do appreciate and much respect for Baron's bus service though. They are all about making sure their passengers feel as though they are royalty. This is something (in my opinion) other bus companies can learn from, over how Baron runs their business. I much respect for Baron. | I do not appreciate how many times whether I tried to come in contact with Flixbus, the store I purchased my ticket, or anyone related, I was made to feel everything is my fault. If I had a bus ticket to be cancelled which cost me nearly $100, and I purchased it by cash because my card will not accept a bus ticket purchase. I was made to feel it was my fault and I have to accept a voucher and lost of money. When I was unaware the inaccuracy of my bus route from Columbus, OH to Louisville, KY and got left for not arriving on the ""correct"" time, it was my fault. Despite the fact I am not the one who runs FlixBus and was not told by anyone until I made it to the Columbus, OH bus stop, which was very unclean and very tiny. The staff there however, were very sweet. When I made it to the Daytona, OH bus station, the bus driver and manager there complained it was my fault for being unaware of the inaccuracy of the bus route. I was told I should contact Customer Service, well, the lady over Columbus, OH station did that for me because she understood I was unaware. Again, I was unaware there was a flaw and felt I should not have to call over something that I expected by the bus company (or FlixBus) to had made sure everything was accurate for passengers. So, I guess I am suppose to call over all my bus route tickets before going on my trip(s)."

There is not a single thing this company does well and, most importantly, they don't fix mistakes and have designed a website to prevent the customer getting refunds and compensation. |  | Specifically: | 1) I made booking; | 2) FlixBus unilaterally, and without explanation, changed the bus I was on to one that departed an hour later; | 3) I had deliberately booked row 1 in order to have a view; | 4) They moved me and my + 1 to row 6; | 5) I paid a premium for row 1 and it was not refunded; | 6) The WiFi did not work on the bus; | 7) I AM ASKING FOR A REFUND OF THE ROW 1 PREMIUM SINCE THE PRODUCT WAS NOT DELIVERED. | I AM ASKING FOR A REFUND OF 50% OF THE PAID FARE FOR THE NON-FUNCTIONAL WIFI. | This should be reimbursed to my credit card. Not a travel credit as that would be useless. I do not plan to travel on Flixbus again. |  | Update Sept. 5th, 2024: The private correspondance referred to by Flixbus in their reply acknowledged the refund for premium seats. However, the they did not take responsibility for their non-functioning WiFi, or for unilaterally and inexplicably changing the scheduled bus that I was on. The reply was mainly a slew of empty bromides about how wonderful they are. They are not, and I will use alternatives to FlixBus in future. They are every bit as awful as I described."

The first journey however was poor. There were two drivers on the service. One driver was calm and polite. The second one became angry and aggressive when we tried to find out if we needed to stay on the bus or take a connection.

Flixbus Global,Flixbus in Sweden,5,,2024-08-21T08:33:57.000Z,"Great price, no delays, comfort, the option of choosing seat. I travelled with Flixbus in France and now Sweden. Recommend to budget tourists."
Flixbus Global,Great service,5,,2024-08-21T07:47:22.000Z,"We were let down by our lift home from the airport, a few days before we came home. It was so easy to book the flix bus, much cheaper than we thought it would be. The driver was so friendly and kept us informed of the route and what stops were coming up. Bus was lovely, clean and very comfortable. Would definitely recommend this service."
Flixbus Global,The seat that I purchased was broken,3,,2024-08-21T07:07:59.000Z,"The seat that I purchased was broken. The back would not stay up and I would end up laying on the passenger behind me if I sat back. I had to sit forward to avoid this happening. After a couple of stops, and all passengers were on board (about 1 hr into a scheduled 5 hr trip), there was one empty seat available, so I moved there for the remainder of the trip. There was lots of traffic, making our arrival delayed by 1.5 hrs, obviously not the bus lines fault, although I believe the overall trip time was originally underestimated."

Flixbus Global,Stay Away at All Costs,1,,2024-08-21T00:02:09.000Z,"I know, I know, “but it’s so cheap!” Alas, I fell victim to the same thoughts. Please don’t give in, and never book with Flixbus. Truly the worst bus service in existence. The website stated that there was Wi-Fi and power outlets, which was a lie. My bus had neither. My bus also had a broken bathroom door that kept sliding open and shut throughout the trip, making loud slamming sounds each time. The air conditioning was not working very well, barely keeping the bus at a tolerable temperature. In South Florida. In August. The air vents above the seats didn’t work at all. |  | Per the Terms and Conditions, the only refund you will ever get (if they even decide to refund you at all), is a voucher. Yes, a voucher, for a service I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. How pathetic. Whoever owns this company should be forced to travel on this horrible bus for the rest of their natural lives."
Flixbus Global,Brussels-Paris-Brussels,3,,2024-08-20T23:18:55.000Z,The outbound trip from Brussels to Paris got delayed during the travel due to an unexpected technical issue. We could have saved time if alternate arrangement was done sooner | The return trip was quite good with respect to time and comfort as well
Flixbus Global,Never again.,1,,2024-08-20T21:55:15.000Z,"Purchased a ticket, including a seat assignment. Arrived 30 minutes early. Bus never came. Went home. During our trip home a message arrived saying the bus was delayed. Made the trip back to the bus stop. That bus never came. A different bus arrived and assured us that they would get us to our destination. They drove us part way and then we were required to book another bus to get us to the destination - 10 hours later than we were supposed to arrive. I had to book a limo service to take us. If a bus isn't available - then the company should be able to inform those with reservations at least 24 hours in advance so that they can make other arrangements. And they should refund the full cost of the trip. They didn't."

Furthermore, in 5.5 hours trip from Zadar to Zagreb we stopped only once for 10 minutes which is definitely too less. We almost lost our seat although we bought the ticket on time."

Flixbus Global,Disgusting customer service,1,,2024-08-20T03:02:40.000Z,I purchased 4 tickets from Seattle to portland for me and my three children. We arrived on time and found our bus number on our tickets. I presented my ticket to the driver and he said he was not going to portland and to not board his bus but rather sort this out with customer service. I called flix and was on hold so long the bus had departed. The customer service person would not listen to what I needed to explain and he refused to issue a refund which left me and my three children stranded in Seattle with no way home and $300 poorer. He had no patience or compassion or listening skills. I am disgusted with Flix Bus and will never use them.

The extra fee of 4.99€ that I’ve paid for both of my trips should be refunded automatically. It is a deceiving service to offer the reserve seat option when the configuration of the bus is totally different at the time of departure. Terrible service overall."

I also had to pay fees to change my ticket despite the fact that they changed the ticket. |  | They would not refund the rebooking fee."

Flixbus Global,We got there through a miserable journey,2,,2024-08-19T12:24:00.000Z,"When we boarded the bus the bathroom had urine all over the seat and floor and there was no toilet paper. Additionally our seat was broken and kept sliding off but the bus was full and we were traveling with children so we did not want to separate. We travelled from Paris to Ljubljana, which was an 18 hour trip with no bathroom and a broken seat. It was down right awful. Additionally, knowing the bathroom was not usable, there was one point where we went 5 hours and 15 minutes with no ability to get off the bus and use the restroom. I am highly disappointed."

Flixbus Global,"Do not trust on FlixBus staff, customer service, and drivers!!!",1,,2024-08-19T02:37:14.000Z,"Hello, |  | I want to express my dissatisfaction with how my situation has been handled after I lost my mobile phone on board a FlixBus. Here’s a summary of the incident: |  | Lost my phone : I lost my phone on the bus, and when I contacted the bus driver, he confirmed that he had it. He directed me to FlixBus policy and asked me to fill out a form to retrieve my phone. | Followed All Steps: I followed all necessary steps as per FlixBus guidelines and reported the incident. However, after two weeks, I received the message that the lost and found department couldn’t locate my phone. This surprised me, as the bus driver had confirmed having it. | Inadequate Customer Service: I also reached out to FlixBus customer service, but their response has been insufficient. It’s frustrating that they can’t assist me despite having onboard surveillance cameras. | Similar Experiences: I’ve heard similar stories from friends who never got their lost baggage back from FlixBus. This raises concerns and affects my trust in the company. | I hope that those reading this take it seriously and consider improving their handling of lost items. I request that you investigate the surveillance cameras from the trip on July 31 at 2:30 AM between Hamburg and Oslo. I disembarked in Malmö."
