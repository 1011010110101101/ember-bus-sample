How can they only know 15 minutes before that it’s not running? The alternatives given were a minimum of 4 hours later from a totally different part of the city. So now I’m £45 down after having to buy a train ticket. Customer service isn’t even open on weekends so you can’t chat to anyone. Absolute nightmare, I would never use again."

Flixbus UK,Bus did not turn up,1,,2025-03-29T13:55:57.000Z,Arrived early for 9.55am bus. Received a text advising delay until 10.16. Then another until 10.22 but the bus did not show up. There were no further updates and the status remained to show as being delayed but the tracker showed the bus to be half way to it's destination. It had obviously bypassed our pickup point to make up time. Ourselves and another passenger had to rebook a later bus and hour later. We had an hour and half wait at a freezing unsheltered pick up point. Also customer contact number is a Berlin number!

Flixbus UK,Please Be Cautious When Choosing FlixBus,1,,2025-03-29T02:38:39.000Z,"Please Be Cautious When Choosing FlixBus as Your Travel Partner |  | I had a terrible experience with FlixBus — by far the worst service I’ve encountered. Due to their mistake, I had to pay a a lot, and they showed absolutely no concern for the situation they put me in through their poor handling and rescheduling. |  | Their customer service is third-class — unhelpful, dismissive, and completely lacking in empathy. I was left in a very difficult situation when their driver refused to let me and my wife on board simply because their scanning machine couldn't read my valid barcode. I politely asked the driver to wait just 5 minutes so I could speak with customer service and sort out the issue, but he refused. This was particularly unfair considering passengers had already been made to wait over 30 minutes while the driver took his break in Manchester. |  | This level of unprofessionalism is unacceptable. I ended up paying over a lot to reach my destination using alternative transport, not to mention the mental stress and inconvenience caused — something that cannot be compensated easily. |  | FlixBus is running an unfair and irresponsible business in the UK. Such behavior should be taken seriously, and I believe the Traffic Commissioner should consider reviewing their operating license. |  | Travelers deserve better — be cautious before booking with FlixBus."

Upon realizing the mistake, I reached out to the customer service team for assistance. Unfortunately, instead of receiving help, I was informed that I would need to pay an additional £9.75. It’s worth noting that the desired travel was for the same day and time but had a different departure point. The ticket I had purchased was £4 more expensive than the alternative option I was considering. I was not requesting a refund, just looking for assistance with the situation as the oversight could happen to anyone .. | Very mean and wicked customer service team. |  | Very terrible"

Flixbus UK,flix bus Italian trip,2,,2025-03-25T10:29:11.000Z,We are travelling to Italy later this year and booked seats to Puglia. The booking system was easy but the luggage situation was misleading. I paid for 4 suitcases and when the confirmation came through it stated 8 pieces of luggage. I tried to contact the company but as usual had to do this via their refund page. They sent me a voucher which I will never use. We are pensioners having a train and road trip and probably will never do this again because of pre existing conditions. When I asked if we could have a refund instead of a voucher they stated that it was in the terms and conditions no refunds of money. So travellers beware really make sure you don’t make any mistakes with Flix bus as they will not refund money.

Flixbus UK,The BEST and CHEAPEST way to travel around the UK,5,,2025-03-23T22:26:35.000Z,"I have made many trips to Birmingham from London and back and I will use always use FlixBus and no one else. | To begin with, they are the cheapest and even fastest!! The train which costs nearly £50 takes 2 hours 20 minutes (usually much longer with delays) while FlixBus takes 2 hours 40 minutes (though my last 3 trips took only 2 hours...a record!!). The cost is never more than £13!! | The coaches are always on time and if they are getting delayed an email is sent well in advance. | The drivers are amazing, efficient and polite and the service is fantastic! | The buses are clean and comfortable and it is like having a 5 star travelling experience!! | FlixBus are the BEST!!"
Flixbus UK,Disgraceful behaviour from driver,1,,2025-03-23T22:16:25.000Z,Our driver was extremely rude. It took 1.5hrs to get from Finchley Rd to Victoria. We received no communication from the driver. Instead he was talking to someone on loudspeaker in his own language. He told the woman sitting behind him to sshhhh when she was talking to someone on the phone and was incredibly rude when a youman went to ask him what the problem was. When we arrived at Victoria I asked why he didn't communicate with us? Apparently he's a driver not a communicator and I should have looked at my phone for answers. He gave me very rude hand gestures and made everyone get their own cases out of the hold. This was my 1st and last time of using Flixbus. Disgraceful behaviour

No respect, still I didn't got refunded for my week I had booked and paid under better circunstance, It is very dishonest, it is not possible to get rid of Booking .com they pop up all the time, they are the one taking over my booking and put me with mix people I am a women, I don't want to share with men. Way to aggressive for my taste. Thank you for good service. I will continue my bookings with you from now on."

Highly unprofessional."

Flixbus UK,What choice would you make?,1,,2025-03-20T19:42:58.000Z,"I booked to use the FlixBus service a few weeks before departure to take two of us to a London airport. |  | The departure day and time arrived (midnight), but there was no FlixBus present and neither was there any communication via text or email from FlixBus. |  | An alternative opportunity arose with a different coach company, so I attempted making contact with FlixBus to find out the situation - but they only open from 8am to 8pm - and it was now way past midnight. |  | The alternative transport was about to leave and, without knowing what was happening regarding our FlixBus transport, I opted to secure two seats on the other coach. |  | When requesting a refund for FlixBus services not rendered, it was refused as, apparently, the FlixBus DID eventually leave - but an hour and a half later than scheduled! |  | The FlixBus representative could not explain why there was no communication. Neither could the representative explain why the bus was one and a half hours late! |  | Now, the two of us could have waited in the cold, at night, while tired, in the hope the FlixBus MIGHT arrive - but even then, there was no guarantee that it would. I needed to secure transport to the airport. What would you have done? |  | I will NOT be booking FlixBus again and neither can I recommend the service. |  | The FlixBus service all-around is poor!"

Flixbus UK,False best price guarantee and no power socket,1,,2025-03-11T12:19:42.000Z,The company is false advertising their best price guarantee. On their website it says the earlier you book the cheaper. I booked my journey in advance and the on the day of travel the price dropped for both of my outward and return journey. I spoke to their customer service team and asked them to honor the best price guarantee they promised. The agent rejected and claimed they price dynamically and no refund will be given. They also advertised their bus is equipped with power socket. It is false marketing too. I am very disappointed with their customer service and would not recommend travel with FlixBus. A very dishonest business.

Last minute booking due to Eurostar cancellations. | Bercy station is awful, no signage, grotty, rat infested, and intimidating people hovering around | Bus was late. En route to ferry passenger was aggressive and threatening to people back of coach. Because of late departure, ferry was missed and 3 hour wait at port at 1 am. Decided enough is enough and bought a train ticket to use from Dover to lo London.. dfds don't let off foot passengers so asked the driver to drop us off outside when the coach leaves, he agreed .. driver drove straight into motorway and to London. Meaning we were late again and wasted money on train tickets. |  | Never ever ever again ! I used Megabus a few times when they did the channel crossing service. And had no problems. | This was an experience I'll never forget and will warn people to stay away. Spend a bit more and fly, or drive or use the Eurostar."

I then informed them that I had paid for a hotel so an indication would be good. They informed me of the number of people booked on and told me that the bus should be running. I then queried as to how many were booked on for the return journey. I received a really rude and aggressive response and they cut me off the chat!

Because of this we nearly missed our eurostar train to Paris and a whole disneyland holiday. And their customer service, there’s no customer service.

I have always been a person with a sensetive stomach and as a student its hard to get cheap deal to go to london for an Important academic event... anyways, so I had an early morning bus and the driver Benny or something had to stop to get costumers... but on the road i got clammy and little nausea since i am usually a sensetive person with trips and stuff... i told him can i quickly purchase a bottle of water and a little snack to keep me comfortable in a near by shop... he said no, since no shops available in the area but the costa literally few steps away was open. Then he told us that he will stop for a pee break? I tried to get his attention and he didn't hear me what so ever... then he decided not to pee... it's just very frustrating bc I simply need a bottle of water and a few crackers to feel better and have a good and tolerable Journey but yeah... I use flix bus often and never had this much of a fuss before... all the previous drivers were kind and caring. The bus was clean but again toilets were horrible like always and my seat was missing a bin bag"

My outbound trip met with a mechanical issue that meant parking on the hard shoulder for a mechanic to arrive & fix which did happen but meant my arrival was too late for an important Court sentencing & to support family members. My return trip began late & firstly a pull in to a service station for driver handover & again further along for driver to sort out his ""drivers card"" all of which took extra time. This ultimately resulted in my return home being nearly 2 hours late & I still had a further trip to make to get home. I appreciate you cannot second guess every situation but my trip cannot be heralded as the best experience on my first Flixbus journey. However the coach was clean & comfortable & I may use them again in the future hoping this was not the normal service they provide..."

I had a ticket for bus UK940 from Heathrow to Bristol on February 20th, but due to a failure in their communication, I missed the bus. The bus was delayed, but I wasn’t notified that it had actually left earlier than expected. I followed all instructions, arriving 15 minutes early, but when I checked the app, the departure time had already passed. The lack of real-time updates and poor customer service response has left me frustrated and out of pocket. I’m requesting a full refund due to the communication failure on FlixBus’s part, but the company has refused to assist. Would not recommend."

Flixbus UK,"Try somebody else, they’re awful",1,,2025-02-21T21:34:16.000Z,"We waited at the location stated on our tickets only to watch the bus go sailing past. I spoke to customer services trying to get transferred onto the next outbound coach but they refused so l had to pay for another set of return tickets at around $150 so all in all paid almost $300 for 2 people between Calgary and Banff. | After speaking to the driver of the next coach he said the pickup location was actually the other side of the carpark, not where is pinpointed on the tickets. I won't be using these again after this valuable lesson. | If you ever do choose to use FlixBus hopefully you don't get ""Brad"" as a driver, he was all over the road and seemed more interested in frequently passing his phone to an Australian couple to show them photos he'd taken of various parts of Canada. |  | FlixBus are shysters and refused to refund my money or transfer tickets due to their very poor information. I sent them a screenshot of my position at the pickup location I was told to meet at just as the coach drove past but still they refused. | There are other coach companies that do similar routes to FlixBus so l'd urge you to try them instead."

Checked online and told it would be 30min late to take off at 9.45 instead of original 9.15. | Went into the mall as it was raining and had a 5 year old with me only to come out at 9.33 and be told the bus had left, tracked online and showed 9.28 instead of previous 9.45. | Saw another bus going to Aberdeen who was extremely unhelpful and insisted I needed to buy another ticket to get on, refused giving his name with me eventually having to shell out additional 30 or so pounds in addition to being delayed for important appointment. | Never had this with megabus or national express, definitely never using again and would be putting in formal complaint."

BUT I’d also booked and PAID for a double seat for my son but I noticed on the new details he only had 1 seat. | I contacted them by phone, which wasn’t a great experience as the person spoke limited English and was obvs reading from a script!!!!

Flixbus UK,Night trip to Glasgow from London,1,,2025-02-06T07:55:44.000Z,"Night trip to Glasgow from London, First of I was given the wrong seat which I didn't book, no leg room and I'm a short man, seats recline about 2 degrees only, no charging outlet for each seat, need to give your device to the driver to charge, packed in like sardines, there like the smallest seats ever and rock hard, there was no one asking just a few passengers to be quiet as this was a night bus, so I got no sleep at all for 10 hours.

When we got into the bus someone was seating on my dad's seat and the bus driver started to shout at Us and was being very rude to my whole family then he said seat wherever you find space.

I had to take a taxi instead, but FlixBus refuses to issue a refund for the unused tickets. |  | Customer service has been a nightmare. They ignored key details, contradicted themselves, and even falsely claimed my ticket was scanned, despite me never boarding. After multiple emails and providing all the proof I could, they still refuse to help."
Flixbus UK,"Stress-free trip, stay away from Flixbus",1,,2025-02-03T16:51:02.000Z,"For your own good and a hassle-free journey, stay away from this company! I've had two serious incidents with them already. |  | The first one happened a year ago when, less than two hours before the bus was supposed to arrive, I was informed via email or SMS (I can’t remember exactly) that the bus had an issue and the trip was canceled. How can you notify someone just two hours in advance? I had to rely on friends to find an alternative, and my vacation was ruined. I thought it was an isolated case and decided to give the company another chance. |  | Not long after, I had another issue. I booked seat 1A, which costs an extra €3.99, if I remember correctly. A week after my reservation was confirmed and the money was taken, I received an email stating that my seat was no longer available. Instead, they reassigned me to a random seat at the back without even asking if I agreed to the change or if I wanted a refund. |  | It was clear that they had resold my seat, probably because 1A was next to 1B, and they didn’t want it to appear occupied in the system. Someone else must have been able to book 1A while I was left with no choice but to accept the change. The irony? There were still available seats in the same front row, like 1C and 1D, but they didn’t even bother offering me one. |  | When I checked the system, I noticed that only a few seats were taken, which made it obvious—they double-sell tickets even after you've already booked and paid for them. If they can squeeze out an extra €3.99, why not, right? Pure greed. But this kind of behavior will cost them their customers in the long run, and I truly hope their company collapses. |  | As for me, I will never use their services again. Consider this a warning—if you want a stress-free trip, stay as far away from them as possible."

He started by playing his own loud music whilst smoking, dancing in his unbelted chair and constantly answering his mobile phone. He tried to overtake an articulated lorry on a mountain bend, eventually succeeding much to his pleasure but to the annoyance of his fellow passengers and the driver of the lorry. We headed into a thunderstorm, he had his wipers on full but still couldn’t see. I had to shout out ‘slow down’ before he did so. Other incidents also occurred too numerous to mention, but I recorded most of them. I hope the company contact me and sack him. Use this company at your peril !"

Flixbus UK,Beware of Flixbus Transaction Fees!,1,,2025-01-26T19:20:27.000Z,"Having had our Heathrow airport bus cancelled 30 minutes before departure,we were promised a full refund by Flixbus. I received a message saying that our refund had been processed.Upon checking my bank account I found a transaction £11 less than the agreed refund amount.I contacted Flix and they told me that they were not responsible for any charges imposed by customers' banks in the UK. After researching the company, I found that the refund was sent from Germany and that Flix choose to pass on any international transfer fees to customers.So, if your bus doesn't turn up and you try to get a refund then you'll be charged for it- this is a scam! UK customers are being penalised for Flix choosing to operate from Germany.Beware!!!!"

He left 3 young girls on who were nothing short of annoying. They got people to change seats so they could sit together, then one played on her phone from London to Newport, where they changed seats, thankfully, but then they refused to move for the person who seats they were in. |  | We pay extra to allocate seats so the drivers should adhere to the seating plans. |  | London to Swansea 25th January 18:30."

Flixbus UK,Decent option for long-distance journeys,4,,2025-01-25T09:18:55.000Z,"I've used Flixbus a number of times for long-distance journeys. I get a lot of perplexed responses from friends (""why don't you just fly/take the train?"") but I stand by my decision to travel with Flixbus. I prefer to avoid flying for environmental reasons, and often the journeys I need to make are more expensive and/or more complicated (lots of changes) by train. Flixbus is very easy and convenient, and on a Flixbus -- unlike a train -- you are guaranteed a seat and somewhere to store your luggage! Sure, 15+ hours on a coach (or any form of transport) is never going to be the most fun in the world, but Flixbus make it as tolerable as possible e.g. generally if you are on a long journey there will be at least one short break where you can get out of the bus and stretch your legs etc.. My recent Flixbuses have also been very punctual, arriving if anything a bit early -- never late. My only complaint is that on a recent Flixbus the bus was far too hot for the final few hours of the journey, which made me feel a bit ill -- however, this hasn't generally been a problem, I think they just had the heating turned up a bit high on that particular bus. One thing to bear in mind (for any Flixbus novices!) is that not all of the Flixbus stops have facilities like waiting areas etc.; some of them are just bus stops on the roadside/in a parking lot -- so be careful, if you are planning a journey with a long wait between connections, that you are changing at a location with somewhere safe and comfortable to wait. Also consider time of day (I once had a slightly unpleasant experience changing at Paris Bercy in the early hours of the morning). Several of the Flixbus stops are at actual bus stations or at other public transport stations (rail stations, airports) where you can use the facilities associated with those stations. Frankfurt also now has a nice warm designated Flixbus waiting room (I think a few other buses use it too, mostly Flixbus though) and toilets (costing 1 euro), which I appreciated very much during my recent 6-hour wait between buses at Frankfurt (on a chilly January day and with too much luggage to want to wander far!). All in all -- would recommend."

Waited for a bus in Glasgow for over an hour only to be advised by a driver on another route “don’t hold your breath!! They’ll likely cancel it” said driver even tried to call himself and got nowhere - and he was an employee! Had no choice but to catch a last minute train at great expense only to be told I’m not even eligible for a refund as the bus did eventually turn up almost 2 hours late and because I didn’t wait it out on the off chance i would be able to get home I get nothing back - despite the fact their own customer service team were unable to update me either when contacted on the status of the bus - never again!

The bus drove off and left us? Luckily there was a National Express bus leaving for Gatwick and they had plenty of staff to assist - several from Flix bought tickets and the bus left 30 mins later. On the bus I messaged Flix via their messaging app and after several attempts and discussions I was refused a refund because they said I had checked into the Flixbus? I hadnt even got on the bus? I sent a copy of my National Express ticket recepit and they still claimed I had checked into on the bus and refused any refund. Just to repeat I had not got on the bus as the driver refused entry - Flix has no ground staff, no customer support and refusing a refund given I hadnt even got on the bus is criminal - I would avoid Flix for any important trips and opt for National Express"

Also the amenities were not quite the same as stated (foods and snacks aren't offered nor is there a toilet onboard)"
Flixbus UK,Fantastic Flixbus Journey,5,,2025-01-20T19:04:16.000Z,Fantastic bus trip to London and back. On time and comfortable. Ease to get to bus stops from other bus services. Great price as Trains unreliable and expensive. Spent 40 mins in Bristol station last time. Had to be in London by 12:00. Coming back trains cancelled and people had to stand all the way back from London. You don’t expect that for the money they charge. Guaranteed seat on coach and very resonble.
Flixbus UK,No stars FLIXBUS DRIVER THEFTS,1,,2025-01-26T18:42:22.000Z,No stars ever! Flixbus Coach Driver left Victoria Station 19th January with one of my bags and drove off! Flixbus say it will take 1 week for me to get my bag back although it is stolen by him with all my equipment. Driver drove off quickly with the bag knowing I was waiting for it and only unloaded my clothes bag after telling the passengers to get off the Coach. Both bags were together. Flixbus told me to wait at Victoria Station for 24 hours until he returned with my equipment bag he has stolen! Flixbus are telling me I have to wait 1 week for them to check the CCTV on the Coach which shows what the Coach Driver has done with my bag and equipment. This is the worst 24 hours of my life!! I cannot do any filming and have had to cancel all bookings and my Course Work is all in the equipment bag and stored on my Camera in the equipment bag. I had travelled from Paris where I filmed for a couple of days. DO NOT USE FLIXBUS THEY WILL ROB YOU AND CLAIM THEIR POLICY TAKES 1 WEEK TO RETURN YOUR LUGGAGE!! Flixbus support the theft of luggage and rely on the Police to investigate their THEFTS instead of their legal obligations to return luggage temporarily handled on their Coach by their Driver who must be arrested for THEFT. The first thing I did was to report the theft to the Police which does not immediately help for my equipment to be returned. It was an orchestrated THEFT by the Coach Driver SUPPORTED BY FLIXBUS WHO ARE TOTALLY UNHELPFUL AND UNACCOUNTABLE. TFL must shut FLIXBUS DOWN and remove their Coach License that authorises FLIXBUS TO STEAL PASSENGERS LUGGAGE AND DISAPPEAR QUICKLY!! STILL NO RESPONSE FROM FLIXBUS 26th JANUARY AND THEY WANT ME TO WAIT 14 DAYS FOR THEM TO INVESTIGATE THEIR THEFT OF MY BAG!!!!
Flixbus UK,Dangerous Flixbus Driver,1,,2025-01-20T13:25:53.000Z,"I didn't actually use Flixbus, I was unlucky enough to be driving in front of one of their buses in the UK yesterday. | The Flixbus was driving so dangerously, I wouldn't have wanted to be on the Flixbus. I have a picture of how close he was to me, and also a video of him being so close to other cars. | I rang Flixbus, they said they couldn't do anything unless I had booked with them, and I need to report it to the local authority, which I will do and pass along the picture and video. Such aggressive driving for a bus, if I had to slam on my brakes we would of had no chance. I would of have changed lanes, but couldn't of done that either. Shocking driving."
Flixbus UK,How not to run a coach service.,1,,2025-01-20T00:19:00.000Z,"Provided less than an hour's notice that the bus was going to be over an hour late, with no reason given, which would've made me miss my rail connection, meaning I had to quickly make alternative arrangements."
Flixbus UK,FlixBus has improved its the best trip…,4,,2025-01-19T22:59:01.000Z,FlixBus has improved its the best trip I took in Sicily as day trip to athigento and had no problems only it was long as bus stopped at 4 stops on way back over 20 minutes while going it got earlier ! Still it’s the best journey I had in Sicily in 10 days with great wife and very polite good drivers too ! Italian drivers on inter bus are absolutely menacing ! Flix is better than all other three sais ast and interbus ! Bravo
Flixbus UK,Very Good Experience,4,,2025-01-19T13:34:17.000Z,"Bus arrived at the scheduled time, and journey was seamless. However, at the beginning the driver only opened the bus 3 minutes before we were scheduled to leave, and left us to put our luggage in the carriage compartments ourselves. All in all, a great deal"
Flixbus UK,Avoid flixbus the drivers are vile and disgusting towards passengers,1,,2025-01-19T12:52:34.000Z,Travelled on the n31 from London to Glasgow last night and the 2 drivers attitudes and obnoxious behavior towards individuals including my son was absolutely disgusting with absolutely no regard for any passenger whatsoever. The way they speak to passengers is vile and disgusting and it's not discreet the way they slag off passengers the whole bus could hear it and the fact they spayed air freshener after passengers had literally just walked off the bus and was not done discreet whatsoever. This was our 1st time using flixbus and certainly will never use again or recommend anyone use their services the vile and disgusting behaviour of your drivers is totally unacceptable and nobody should have to suffer their vileness telling passengers they were annoying and total contempt towards passengers
Flixbus UK,Avoid. Don’t reserve seats!,1,,2025-01-19T12:41:30.000Z,"Bus arrived late, meaning the driver was already in a bad mood. Was told “there is no reserved seating. Just sit anywhere what’s the problem.” Problem is I paid for a specific seat. | Drive stopped along the route with no announcements. Then swapped driver, he was worse at making announcements, several people missed their stops because announcements weren’t made."
Flixbus UK,Would not recommend,2,,2025-01-19T00:42:27.000Z,"The bus was on time and we also arrived on time. However, it was uncomfortably hot to the point where myself and several other passengers were unwell due to the heat. The toilet was overflowing with brown water and the whole seat and bowl was stained and no toilet paper was provided and the sink was over flowing with brown water, it was completely unusable. Luckily our journey was only 2.45hrs but if it had been longer I do not know what we would have done. The driver stopped at a service station to use the bathroom but did not offer anyone else the chance to exit the bus. The seat arrangement was okay but many passengers argued over their seats and whether they were correctly chosen. No plug sockets worked either, some were completely ripped from the wall."
Flixbus UK,Would not recommend,1,,2025-01-18T15:07:52.000Z,"Sent to the wrong gate, made it back to correct gate prior to departure but refused entry. Told to wait one hour for the next one and then was denied entry even with valid ticket and 10 empty seats on the coach. Ended up spending £75 extra on train travel I was trying to avoid. Their rep was rude and dismissive and hid for most of the time. Awaiting full refund and reimbursement for additional travel"

Flixbus UK,I had a TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE yesterday…,1,,2025-01-17T12:43:19.000Z,"I had a TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE yesterday 16-01-2025. I was scheduled to travel from Amsterdam Sloterdijk to Odense Denmark. The time in my ticket says 20:55. I was at the station by 20:30. I waited for almost more than 3 hours in the cold. I asked all the drivers and none of them knew anything about my trip. I checked my email and my mobile to see if FlixBus sends me reason(s) for the long delay but I didn't get anything. I finally left the Amsterdam Sloterdijk after waiting for so long. |  | This morning, i went back to FlixBus office in station Sloterdijk. After giving my details (3215469856) to the receptionist, i was surprised when the lady told me that my bus never came. She said my trip was cancelled. My trip was cancelled without any information and i got sick in the cold while waiting for cancelled trip. |  | FlixBus made me miss my brother's Wedding in Denmark. I don't want to talk about other damages I experienced. I just hope that I recover from the cold."

Flixbus UK,Flixbus cancelled our return journey…,1,,2025-01-16T20:19:52.000Z,"Flixbus cancelled our return journey within five minutes of the departure time. They then offered us a little over half the refund amount for that single journey and used a combination of exchange rates and unhelpful terms and conditions to justify their meagre return. Thanks to the incompetence we were forced to spend far more on a last minute bus with a different company in order to get home. The total return journey including the refund amount which we had anticipated but not received came to four times the amount that the initial journey should have cost. Their feedback and complaint system was unhelpful, unsympathetic and formulaic. Won't use again."

Flixbus UK,Horrific experience!,1,,2025-01-13T13:43:37.000Z,"Horrific! Use with absolute caution. This company have an inability to operate a reliable service. Received an email informing of a cancelled service at midnight. Woke to find this email and took the option of opting for a free of charge change to another scheduled service…only to find after making a journey to the nearest city that the service was delayed for over an hour - only received an email 20 minutes before! Called the customer service number and after eventually reaching a human being who took a few details, I was put on hold for so long that I incurred a huge phone bill for the privilege…and was cut off before even hearing back from the customer service agent. Absolutely disgraceful service and very costly. Trying to do my bit for the climate by using public transport and it’s completely unreliable and costly."

Additionally, the bus stops and pick-up points are incorrect, which is especially problematic for tourists who are unfamiliar with the area."

Flixbus UK,The bus was around 4h late to the…,1,,2025-01-07T02:02:19.000Z,The bus was around 4h late to the destination which meant I had lost the train ticked I had already paid for. There was no additional information from the driver along the way about the delay either. And when I asked I was informed since I took the bus I am not eligible for any compensation. Drivers also didn’t seem very friendly and before departure form each stop no one counted the passengers. Additionally the toilet was locked for the remaining 2h of the journey so no one could use the lavatories. I was also told I should put my backpack in the luggage compartment and it was lost. Overall i would say use any other means of transport you have.

I booked tickets and reserved my seats, but it seems your system didn’t actually reserve them. Even though I have proof of the reservation, I wasn’t charged for the seats. This experience has been very disappointing. I think I’ll stick with your competitor from now on—at least when I | book and reserve seats with them, the process is straightforward and honored without any problems. I also complained about your driver wearing earphones while driving. This raised serious safety concerns for me and other passengers. Furthermore, the temperature on the coach was uncomfortably high, and despite my request to the driver, the air-conditioning was not turned on."

Flixbus UK,Please fix seat assignment issue,3,,2025-01-04T17:03:39.000Z,"Huge negative: it's always messy with seats assignment in the Flixbus UK. My experience all the times I am using it: I have seat assigned , someone is already sitting there, they say that somebody was seating on their seat so they took another one. They suggest I take another one. Ok, I actually don't mind (as I didn't book the seat it was just assigned to me), I take another one only to have someone coming to me minutes later and claim it is their seat. It is a really bumpy start to be honest! |  | To avoid that I'd suggest to clearly mark each reserved seat as ""reserved"" (where people paid for that) so that people would not sit there, and keep the rest unassigned. It seem to work for National Express. |  | If not that issue above, I'd put 5, as otherwise the bus itself is nice and clean and the driver is polite, schedules are good etc. Just please fix the seating problem!"

I stopped with them after I got stranded at a station as their bus was cancelled couple of hours before the travel and there was no other option available as it was holidays. Never gonna take any more chances with them just to save couple of bucks. Their service is absolute nightmare!

Flixbus UK,Complaint Regarding Unacceptable Behavior of FlixBus Driver on Route 807 on December 28,1,,2025-01-03T01:22:52.000Z,"Subject: Urgent: Complaint Regarding Unacceptable Behavior of FlixBus Driver on Route 807 |  | Dear FlixBus Customer Service, |  | I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding an incident that occurred on your bus, Route 807, traveling from Brussels Gare du Midi to Paris Bercy Seine on December 28th at 11:40AM |  | During the journey, I witnessed a deeply upsetting and disturbing incident involving one of your drivers. The issue stemmed from the fact that my traveling companion and I were unable to purchase a ticket for a 1-year-old child, as your system does not allow tickets for children of that age, and there was no option to add her to our existing tickets. Despite this, the driver refused to allow the child to board the bus and insisted that she could not travel. |  | We then purchased a ticket for an adult to cover the child, but the driver still refused to let us board. In an incredibly inappropriate and aggressive manner, the driver physically pushed the mother, who was holding the 1-year-old, off the bus. This behavior was completely unacceptable, and we were left feeling shocked and distressed by the situation. |  | This treatment was not only rude but also highly discriminatory and harmful. No passenger should ever experience such behavior, especially when traveling with a young child. I am deeply concerned about the safety and customer service standards of FlixBus, as this incident clearly shows a failure to uphold basic dignity and respect for your passengers. |  | I urge you to investigate this matter thoroughly and take the necessary action against the driver involved. It is crucial that FlixBus ensures its staff is properly trained to handle sensitive situations and that all passengers, regardless of their age, are treated fairly and with respect. |  | Please confirm that you have received this complaint and let me know the steps you plan to take to address the issue. I also appreciate any information you can provide regarding the investigation process. |  | Thank you for your attention to this serious matter. I look forward to your prompt response. |  | Kind regards, | Jeneva"

Flixbus UK,Had a bus booked for 2 adults and 2…,1,,2024-12-31T14:10:58.000Z,"Had a bus booked for 2 adults and 2 children dated 31.12.2024. Bus was due to leave Dundee at 9.55 to travel to Glasgow. Received a text message at 7.04 to say bus was cancelled and to reschedule a new bus for free. This was done between 7.30 and 8am. Got a new bus booked for 9.25 and Family of 4 stood at the bus stop waiting from 9am. Came to 9.25 and no bus arrives that says Glasgow only Edinburgh. I had checked my email for the new booking number and spoke with a driver who told me this wasn’t our bus so we didn’t get onit. We stood waiting for a further 45 minutes before an Aberdeen bus arrived, then spoke with that bus driver who told me not to worry as I was panicking with it being my daughters 11th birthday , to contact flix customer service, tried to do this but the price of the call was scandalous so used the app and got connected to an agent named janine or Janet, who said she would help. Came back 3 minutes later and told me , no refund, no getting put on the next bus unless I pay again, I then proceed to tell her , I’ve been waiting over an hour for a bus , I was 25 minutes early , I’m stranded with 2 kids can someone help me as this is no fault of mine, got told no. So basically to put it into one, the original bus was cancelled, the one that did arrive was infact my bus but the driver told me it wasn’t, so how is that my fault? And why am I now out of pocket? Wasn’t the only person either. When I spoke with the agent I also told her there is several others who haven’t got that bus as I spoke with passengers who all said the same thing to be told ‘ they all made it on the bus ‘ even tho I stood there for a further 45 minutes waiting. Honestly , this isn’t the first time I have used flix bus , anytime I have in the past there hasn’t been an issue but after this I won’t be using this service and I don’t want others to either , because if anything goes wrong and your in a situation like me where I didn’t have the extra money to book another bus esp with young children , on there birthday too! I would hate for this to happen to anyone else."

Flixbus UK,Ciise saved us from rejected valid ticket!,2,,2024-12-30T18:13:10.000Z,"It would be 1-star review if it wasn’t for Ciise!! This guy saved our trip! Appreciate it! |  | Flixbus converted a simple trip to a terrible and stressful experience. My girlfriend and I, had booked 2 tickets, London to Leeds and back for Christmas eve, months ago, due to the probable high demand on that day. | When we arrived for the outbound, the driver told us the our QR code is not valid and we do not have seats in that bus, believing we were mistaken. So the bus driver and the manager there did not let us in and our bus left without us!! | As it turned out, the tickets were correct and flixbus had cancelled our tickets without any notice or refund (!!!) due to some station name change or system problem, I dont know. So imagine, we had booked and paid probably first of all the passengers of the bus and finally we were the only ones without tickets and staying without bus in Christmas eve!! Imagine the stress, the frustration and the injustice of this situation, without having done anything wrong. It was a clear theft and then ignorance from flixbus. | At that point we couldn’t do anything, but fortunately we explained the situation to the manager (probably), who was Ciise, he understood that we were right and acted quickly after understanding the issue. He talked to the bus driver who had already left and agreed that he would wait for us on a next stop where we found him using the subway after 40 minutes! It was a stressful and tiring experience, but at least we managed to find the bus and hop on (without having actual seats, but seating where other previous guys left!)) reaching our destination on time fortunately, thanks to Ciise who arranged the whole thing! | He also updated our inbound tickets without any extra cost, because if we had to wait for flixbus support…we would be still there! And he did all that on Christmas day! Thank you Ciise! |  | We have been using flixbus for a lot of trips and we have never faced or expected a situation like that from a trusted company like that. We didn’t expect either to be dependent on one man’s good will. | Of course we will ask for a refund and hope such a situation doesn’t happen ever again to us or anyone else."
Flixbus UK,Flixbus Review: A Journey of Disappointment,1,,2024-12-30T11:21:13.000Z,"I had high expectations for my trip with Flixbus, but unfortunately, the experience was far from pleasant. The advertised amenities, particularly the Wi-Fi, were one of the main reasons I chose this service. However, at the last minute, the bus was swapped with a subpar one. | The replacement bus was dreadful: | No Wi-Fi, as promised. | Uncomfortable seats that made the journey a literal pain. | The entire bus smelled unpleasant, which added to the discomfort. | To make matters worse, the trip was significantly delayed due to a collision on the road. While I understand that traffic incidents are beyond the company's control, the lack of promised amenities and the poor condition of the bus made the delay unbearable. | Flixbus should ensure that their services meet the advertised standards, even in cases of last-minute changes. This experience has made me think twice about booking with them again"

I check live updates and it’s apparently already left. I speak to customer service and they tell me that it left at 13:41hrs and all passengers are on board. There’s about 7 passengers with me and they said they didn’t get the same coach. Mind you I was at that stop from 13:20hrs. So unless I’m blind or that coach was powered by superman, I didn’t see shit. They refused to refund my ticket and customer service had the cheek to say “Have a nice trip” like I’m supposed to abracadabra to my destination."

Flixbus UK,Appalling service and ethos.,1,,2024-12-27T13:03:30.000Z,"My partner booked a 19:45 coach on boxing day, solo traveller, female. Flix changed the departure time, without informing her, to 19:30. She arrived at the stop at 19:30 to find the bus leaving already. She tried to resolve the issue with the helpline, who promptly logged off at 20:00, leaving her stranded. A lone, female traveller. Luckily we could make arrangements to get her somewhere to stay, but this won't be the case for everyone. |  | Flix have just said they won't refund the ticket because the bus wasn't 2 hours late. It boggles my mind that they can do this. They literally changed the time and dint give any notice. How can they claim they provided the service as paid for? I'd be grateful to anyone who can comment on a way to hold them to account. |  | The refund is one matter. But I'm also pretty angry about the disregard for their customers' personal safety. The person on the chat knew she was stranded due to their changed departure time, but reached the end of their shift and simply logged off. Flix gave no comment on the safety implications at all. |  | No refund, no coverage of costs for alternative travel and accommodation, no acknowledgement that they put someone in a potentially dangerous situation. I'll certainly never use them again, and I'd urge others not to either."

Flixbus UK,Lost for words with this company,1,,2024-12-26T20:50:13.000Z,"Lost for words with this company. Received a text message about the relocation of the bus stop where the bus was meant to collect us from. Not ideal but I purchased a taxi to get across the city to the designated area. Upon arrival to the bus stop there was several individuals waiting for the same bus. 30 minutes after the bus was meant to arrive all the individuals that were waiting for the same bus have started to contact the customer service. We all were informed that they don’t know where the bus is or when it’s arriving. After additional 30 minutes of wait I then decided to go to the main bus station and get some information. The amazingly helpful individual that was NOT part of the Flix bus team has informed me that the bus has already left and that the text messages was a complete mislead. How can an individual that’s not part of the company know more than the individuals that work in FLIX bus ! When I have received this information I immediately phoned Flix again to find out how I am going to go home. Over the 25 minutes of useless phone call the staff were lying to me that the bus has arrived at the given bus stop which was complete and utter rubbish. After me informing the staff on the phone that I do have eyes and I was at the bus stop well before the given time, the individual on the phone has admitted that he actually has no idea where the bus went, was or made the original collection. How can you not know were a bus, driver and the passengers are ? I was refused to speak to a supervisor several times. Absolutely horrendous, I suggest everyone stays away from them doesn't matter how attractive the price is. Will never use this company again"

Flixbus UK,Avoid FlixBus at All Costs,1,,2024-12-24T13:11:10.000Z,"I had an absolutely appalling experience on FlixBus while traveling on the Pärnu - Warsaw route (19 December, 21:10 - 10:25, bus number 1205). As a 17-year-old Ukrainian student studying in Estonia, I chose this company to travel home for the holidays, but it turned out to be a terrible decision. |  | The drivers behaved in a disgraceful manner. When I handed in my luggage, they spoke to me in Russian—a language I don’t understand. When I replied in English and informed them I didn’t speak Russian, they insulted me by calling me a “hohol” (a derogatory term for Ukrainians) and a “shakal” (jackal). Such behavior is not only offensive but also deeply discriminatory. |  | Beyond their abusive language, their overall behavior was hostile and unprofessional. They didn’t speak English, which is shocking given that they are working in Europe on an international route. Additionally, the bus lacked Wi-Fi, making the long journey even more inconvenient. |  | This experience was one of the worst I’ve ever had while traveling, and I strongly advise anyone considering FlixBus to avoid it at all costs.

It wasn’t until the mechanic arrived that he told a few passengers of problem, the driver still hadn’t informed or updated the passengers. When a passenger did ask a question, they were given a sharp reply that he didn’t know what was happening. By this time maybe 2 hours had passed and finally the driver informed passengers that other coaches were coming to pick us up, asked how long, again his answer was boarding on rude, that they will be here as soon as they can.

Flixbus UK,Worst bus journey in history …,1,,2024-12-19T17:31:58.000Z,Bus arrived with two drivers that didn't speak English and they were extremely unfriendly. Bus also had a blocked toilet that didn't flush and when I told the driver he acted like I'm crazy to expect a clean working toilet on the bus. We also ended up changing bus unexpectedly without any reason from drivers or proper communication unless you understood their language. It also delayed us which seemed no problem to the drivers as they didn't seem to care about the passengers which also showed by how careless they were driving in the late hours. I can only thank god I made it in time and was able to catch my connection in Warsaw. I have been using flixbus several times to different locations over the years and it saddens me has become of this company.

Flixbus UK,Flixbus is always late,2,,2024-12-18T22:52:31.000Z,"Flixbus is always late! If you want to get to your destination on time, do not use flixbus! | They are more expensive than the more reliable bus. I paid £54 single journey to Bristol expecting I will arrive earlier, but bus is an hour late!. Compared to National Express fare of £34 to Bristol and bus came on time. I was so tired after 19hours plane journey and waiting at the coach station in Heathrow out in the cold is very frustrating. So disappointed! I should have chosen National Express is so much reliable than flixbus."
Flixbus UK,À mixed bag between Manchester and Paris,3,,2024-12-18T22:45:26.000Z,"A mixed bag. |  | We travelled from Manchester to Paris and back on the direct service. |  | We had a fantastic team of drivers on the way out. | They were very attentive, told us everything we needed to know, including when going through the border, customs... |  | They kept the bus clean, drying the steps so no-one would slip. |  | They worked together very well, for instance when passing through tight spots... |  | On the return leg, the drivers hardly said a word to passengers. Didn't bother to say where toilets were, or telling people to use their seat belts. | They didn't say anything about mobile phone use but when my daughter talked to her boyfriend, the non driver told her off in an unacceptable way. Furthermore, their instructions at French border control were unclear which irritated the French security staff who demanded all luggage to be scanned as a result. |  | One passenger was detained at British border control for nearly an hour. The drivers didn't bother to explain what the situation was. |  | When leaving the ferry, the driver made a slight mistake and the right mirror of the bus hit the left mirror of a lorry. No damage done. |  | While I gave our experience 3 stars, I enjoyed the journey and my next trip to Paris will be on-board a Flixbus coach."

I managed to follow it on their app, and it looked like it would departure from Aberdeen with a delay of 1 hour and 40 mins. |  | Looking on the app the buss was still stationed in Aberdeen even after 3 hours. So in that case - I am entitled a refund - I've got the evidence which is their own app. |  | They refused to refund me on the basis that the bus was delayed less than 2 hours - but showing them proof that their buss was still at the station even after 3 hours wasn't enough to convince them. |  | It's a pity because the company seemed great, it was my 3rd experience with them, and I told everyone about their affordable prices and the good conditions on the bus. |  | I won't recommend this company since I feel they stole 16£ from my pocket."

Inside the bus was lovely and warm, as the weather was bitterly cold. | Only problem - people who had boarded earlier, did not comply with seat allocation. Hence our allocated seats were occupied and we had to sit in odd seats. I feel the driver should check and insist as people board the bus, that they sit in their correct allocated seats. Especially, as pre-reserved seats, cost more money than the standard fare. | Only other complaint - the tray table was dirty and had chewing gum stuck to it. Hence, another prior pre-check for cleanliness and hygiene standards, would be advised."

Flixbus UK,Appalling service!,1,,2024-12-12T20:50:22.000Z,"On 9th Dec, I booked a return ticket for my 82 year old Father to visit at Christmas. I chose FlixBus as there was an option to pay for an extra seat next to him which would mean he was more comfortable as has limited mobility. | 3 days after booking, I received an email to say the booking had changed on his return journey - Flixbus had cancelled his extra seat and located him at the rear of the coach on an inside seat. Also, instead of refunding the difference in ticket price, they issued a voucher. | I checked online to see what seats were still available and found there were many empty seats still on the coach - at least 18 options of 2 seats together. I called customer services as I thought this must just be an error. I was told that the seat had been changed and the extra seat cancelled due to either safety reasons or that the seat didn't exist and it was not possible to just move to an alternative pair of seats. When I explained that I was currently looking online and there were many seats available, she kept telling me it was not possible to change to any of these. When asked to explain why I would still be able to book alternative seats but she couldn't honour what I paid for, she just kept telling me no, not possible. I asked if there were 2 people travelling, would there be seats, funnily enough this was possible to book. So they would not honour what I had booked but if I pretended there was someone else travelling, that was ok... | Frustrated with this, I then asked to just cancel the whole journey instead and get a refund - again was told no - not possible and this is clear in their terms and conditions. | I was told the terms and conditions does state no refunds, only vouchers but she did agree to refund the part payment for the extra seat only BUT I would have to wait 14 working days for the refund! By now, I have lost all trust in this company so asked for an email confirmation that the refund had been processed but guess what - no, not possible!! | I have no idea what is going on with this company but it seems like very bad practice - I am wondering if they advertise seats to get the sale and then cancel knowing they won't be refunding the money and they can then resell to someone else to get their cash as well..? | I hadn't heard of this company before but did check reviews and all seemed well before I booked. I should have known better and used a trusted company instead. | I have found the business ethics poor and the customer service shocking - would definitely not recommend."

Flixbus UK,Flix changed my mind about long distance coaches,5,,2024-12-12T03:06:43.000Z,"I originally tried travel with a rival company however their service was very poor. At Victoria Coach Station I happened to talk to a FlixBus driver, joking about why I had been put off using long distance coaches and he said have you tried Flix? I did and the trip was far superior to what I expected, being so I decided to use them again and this is now my third journey to Europe with Flix. I have only had one minor problem using Flix, a major crash closing part of the M3 and the Flix crew not being familiar with English even the police had difficulty telling the drivers what they wanted them to do: turn around to be escorted to the previous exit. It was a shame as the crash was something no one could predict but drivers who had to be told by gestures what the Highways Authority required them to do was concerning. At least once we had been directed onto the diversion route everything, although delayed, went smoothly again. I can really recommend their services, clean warm and comfortable busses, friendly (hopefully familiar with English language) staff and great on-line information and tracking."

Flixbus UK,Zero stars if possible.,1,,2024-12-11T14:29:08.000Z,"I should give zero stars but this is not possible. Before booking our trip to Bruges I checked with their customer service who assured me I could join the bus from London at Dover before it got on the ferry. There is no-one to talk to at FLIX so this was via the chat service on their website. This is good for the company as the only way to have a record of the contact is to photograph it. When we arrived at Dover, no-one knew of how we could join the bus and the Port Police told us FLIX had never picked people up at dover. We watched the bus sail by towards passport control with no way of stopping it. We then bought foot-passenger tickets for the same ferry hoping to join the bus. The Driver refused to let us do so. Therefore we had a useless cruise to and from Calais and lost hundreds of pounds on accomodation and other pre-booked events. We thought about getting a train from Calais to Bruges (4 hours, 2 changes) but could not be sure our return ticket would be accepted."

Flixbus UK,Route Garmisch Partenkirchen to Munich…,5,,2024-12-11T08:22:30.000Z,"Route Garmisch Partenkirchen to Munich airport. Coach came from Innsbruck in the morning and having snow. I expected along delay but it was only 10 minutes late and arrived at airport only 10 minutes late and just outside of Terminal 2. Tip! Take an umbrella or rain Poncho, as there is no cover at the Garmisch Partenkirchen Bus Stop and both times I took a flix from there, it was raining/snowing and I was glad I had an umbrella to keep dry. As the coach arrives from Innsbruck in Garmisch Partenkirchen, the Border police do their checks on the passengers on the coach before we could board. So I guess you could wait in the Bahnhofs Halle and watch out for the bus and then walk the 50 meters to the stop. Also I recommend to reserve a seat as the coach was always full when I have travelled. Would book again. Comfortable seats, pleasant and safe driving driver."

Flixbus UK,Poor service when things go wrong,1,,2024-12-23T10:36:04.000Z,Facts: I booked a return journey in good faith and paid in advance as requested. My outward journey went well. My return journey was cancelled in the early hours of the day I was due to travel and so I awoke to find that my journey had been cancelled without any real reason. I was offered a free ticket on any other bus departing that day. The next available bus was too early for me to get and the next one was at 9pm in the evening meaning a very late arrival home. I was also able to obtain a refund. I needed to travel and reach my destination at the time originally planned. I had two web chats and each agent said that I would be able to get a refund for alternative transport if I arranged it. I had to book a train and so the ticket was £77 due to the short notice. I had to pay. During the journey I applied for a refund as directed by the two agents and uploaded my receipt/ticket. Five days later I have still not received a refund and what with this and other bills I have low funds in my bank account and may end up overdrawn hence causing bank fees - through no fault of my own. I have emailed Flix twice and the agent did not read my communication answering by saying that they could see I had had a successful outward journey. I tried web chat again this morning and was 'on hold' whilst investigations took place but they revealed nothing. I requested to speak to a supervisor or get a call back from one but I was refused. That experience took too long and I had to go to a meeting so left the chat without any resolution. I understand things don't always go to plan but when you make a mistake or change someones plan or schedule then you need to own it and respond rapidly and efficiently. This experience was not my doing and Flixbus have caused me a lot of inconvenience and I am out of pocket. Systems are fast and effective for making sales and taking money but dealing with problems seems to come a poor second best. | UPDATE 23/12/2024 | 18 days later and Flixbus still haven't paid what they owe. It seems clear that if you complain they sit on your money for longer. Appalling service.

However I did receive a message to say the return trip coach was delayed by 20 mins although the coach never turned up until 1 hour and 20 mins later and the driver started shouting orders at us all. I tried calling customer service who were totally inept and were unable to provide a resolution or apology.

Flixbus UK,Really impressed with my experience.,5,,2024-12-09T12:37:37.000Z,"It was so easy to travel on flix bus. I made a round trip from Birmingham to London, the coach arrived before time of departure which allowed us to get on board and get comfortable before setting off. Seats were comfy and it was just a really good experience. Thanks to the driver Joseph too, he gave us updates and added some light humour to them too which made it seem friendly. Will definitely be using the coaches again!"
Flixbus UK,Need more considerate drivers,1,,2024-12-09T12:29:09.000Z,"Need more considerate drivers, I had a message saying our coach was delayed, original time to leave was 8:45pm but the company changed it to 9:55pm, we waited an extra 2 hours for our coach after a 12 hour flight, we walked to the bus stop for 9:35pm to make sure we weren’t going to miss our coach, arrived to find our driver about to drive off, we were begging him to let us on as he was still stationary, he was refusing, even though we were misled by the information given to us from flixbus, they lied saying the bus was delayed when it never was, the driver left us stranded in London without a ride back to wales. That driver is a disgrace to humanity"

Flixbus UK,Stranded with no onward travel provided,1,,2024-12-08T18:41:26.000Z,"Me and my daughter had a weekend trip to London with this bus company. The travel down was delayed as we had to switch busses with the wipers having broken on the journey. Upon meeting the first driver I was taken aback as the the unprofessional manner in which he spoke to passengers. Swearing and being extremely rude to almost all, these passengers were not in anyway difficult. |  | Return journey was the worst. Having parked in a coach stop the driver who at first seemed really nice proceeded to have a shouting argument with another coach driver that needed to park also. It was very unnerving. We then were all ordered to get off the coach as he was not taking us further. |  | Me and my daughter went to get in the warmth and wait to see what we were to do to get the rest of the way home. |  | An hour layer we were told via email by FLIX to make our own way home. Bearing in mind we were at a shopping outlet on the outskirts of a city thus was utterly out of line to be left stranded. |  | I was lucky I had my husband come and drive the extra hour and a half it was to get home as to navigate getting home any other way would have been very intimidating and hard. I felt more upset for the other passengers as they were visibly concerned how to get themselves home. What if they did not have the funds available to get taxis into the city or train tickets home? Goodness knows where you would start with any public transport from a foreign place way outside near city center travel hubs. |  | Never again. Also after emailing them I never received a word back. It may bemore but I will always from now on take the train. |  | Disgusting to leave people stranded, possibly with no way to get onward travel!!!!"

All in all it did the job and got me home when no one could."
Flixbus UK,Poor service,1,,2024-12-08T17:54:43.000Z,"Email half an hour before departure to advise no bus service due to weather conditions. No alternative offered by Flix. So, at the end of a 12 hour flight, I had no way of getting home. Thankfully National Express were running so I managed to get part of the way, then a taxi leaving me £113 out of pocket.

The Cardiff start location at Herbert Street/Lloyd George Avenue also good for drop offs and pick ups |  | Toilet location in middle of bus also better than location at rear of bus. |  | One point of concern is driver stated that small hand luggage cases with Wheels count as hold luggage and should be paid for. This should be noted in booking form. |  | Overall a great new addition
Flixbus UK,Cheap and comfortable travel,4,,2024-12-08T10:14:50.000Z,"The coach was comfortable and well-driven, from Glasgow to Preston but had been designed without reading lights.

The bus itself was clean and comfortable, and I appreciated the thoughtful addition of plastic bags for rubbish. The onboard Wi-Fi was excellent, providing consistent connectivity throughout the majority of the trip with only a brief, one-minute interruption. |  | However, I was disappointed by the lack of a working USB charger at my seat. Despite the window banner indicating their availability, I couldn't locate one, which would have been problematic on a longer journey. |  | Despite this minor inconvenience, the three-hour ride was comfortable and efficient, thanks to the clean environment and reliable internet access."

Driver was also erratic with his interactions with passengers including attempting to manhandle a paying customer off the bus (the customer's crime was arriving a minute late and the driver didn't want to scan his ticket). Considering I was taking this bus to replace a cancelled train journey, the bus experience added additional stress to an already stressful day. I wouldn't recommend Flixbus.

I paid for assigned seat and none of the seats where numbered so we couldn't have found our seat if we wanted to, so they charged me for nothing, that was a complete waste of money.

Flixbus UK,Dreadful from start to finish,1,,2024-12-05T19:19:40.000Z,Driver was very rude and dismissive at one point he refused to take my disabled husband because he didn't know he had a disabled passenger even though I pre registered with the company my husbands wheelchair whenever we had to get off the bus it was too much trouble for the driver to get his wheelchair out the luggage compartment huffing and puffing etc he also told people to sit where you liked even though we had specific seat allocation and the person in our seats would not move as my husband only has one leg moving from one seat to another was impossible causing the person whose seats we were in not to get their allocated seats. The bus from bham to London was delayed over 3 hours due to an accident on the motorway which we accept cannot be helped but no communication whatsoever from the employee who was dropped off a previous bus other than it's delayed and don't know when it will arrive we ended up getting a taxi to the train station and a train to London in order to meet the connecting bus and ferry would not travel with this company again and would not recommend

I chose Flixbus instead of National Express (though they were the same price for this journey) because supposedly the journey took less time. I was lied to, and the customers are not supported when a journey is delayed. You’d assume Flixbus would be apologetic and make an effort to minimize the delay but here I am in a dark bus waiting to arrive 2h late.

Flixbus UK,Flixbus do not care,1,,2024-12-03T14:02:40.000Z,First experience of using flixbus. Our bus was leaving from mulhouse to freiburg. When we got to the German boarder. The bus was stopped and checked by police. A 300 euro fine was issued to the driver who refused to pay and we were told we couldn't leave until the fine was paid. We were then told the battery for the bus was then dead. Driver refused to cancel the trip and said we had to wait for a mechanic which would take up to 11 hours. Nothing nearby for food or drink. No working toilet. |  | Tried speaking to flixbus customer service who are useful as a chocolate tea pot. All they say on live chat is to wait and wait and wait. After awhile they just close your chat after reading and don't reply. |  | Still here after more than 4 hours |  | It's a shame you cannot attach photos

I chose a seat at the front (1D) However, when I entered the bus I discovered that a woman was sat in the seat that I had paid for . The driver asked her once to move but she refused. I therefore had to sit in a different location in the second row, and on the side opposite to what I booked. I booked a seat at the front of the bus due to disability, both physical and mental. Also the bus had no WiFi and no sockets to charge a phone. The driver stated that the bus is different to the usual flixbus. Additionally, the bus was cold as if the heaters were off and a window near the driver was open. I could feel a draught and plainly hear the noise of the road and other traffic."

Flixbus UK,Driver mentality,1,,2024-12-02T19:01:54.000Z,"I had the worst experience with the driver on the 15:30 Bristol to London service on December 2, 2024 (Bus No. UK041). When the bus, already delayed by an hour, finally arrived, I politely asked the driver, ""When can we expect the bus, sir?"" His response was shocking—he shouted at me and replied, ""I am not the only driver, I don't know."" |  | While delays can happen, and I fully understand that buses are machines subject to issues, the attitude of this driver was completely unacceptable. Politeness and clear communication go a long way in such situations, and his behavior left a terrible impression. |  | In contrast, the driver who took over for the journey back from Bristol to London (also Bus No. UK041) was professional and respectful. He took the time to explain the cause of the delay in a calm and polite manner. This is the kind of conduct passengers expect, especially when faced with delays. |  | The company needs to address such unprofessional behavior and ensure all staff maintain a respectful attitude toward passengers. One rude employee can ruin the trust and goodwill built by others."
Flixbus UK,"Terrible experience, use National Express",1,,2024-12-02T17:32:59.000Z,"I left London for Leeds on an early morning journey. Everything started well — the coach was on time, my seat was not occupied and we left on the clock. The first driver had a smooth drive. First issue: the plug sockets were not working and there was no WiFi on board. |  | Later on, there was a drivers’ change. The new driver was utterly unprofessional and overall rude. His driving was terrible, frantic, dangerous and made me feel nauseous. He also honked many times when he was clearly at fault. The communication was barely understandable as his English seemed limited. Along the way, we encountered an issue with an alarm. He stopped the bus on the side of the motorway and went though the coach, ending up with accusing my forward neighbour of activating the sensors and asking him to move seats. The alarm kept going off, so he started opening and closing the emergency door exit frantically while talking to someone helping him on the phone as he was completely unable to fix the issue by himself and required assistance from a fellow passenger to open the door and pull it back all the way strongly, that after being told he wasn’t very strong by the passenger. After a few more minutes, he managed to get the alarm to stop. I reached Leeds with a massive headache and a close to thirty minute delay. This is unacceptable. I am dreading going back to London tonight with a night bus of yours because that journey was atrocious. Not to mention that the bus was cold."

London Victoria Coach Station has barely any seating, so had to wait standing and were kept on our toes as the screen kept stating ""delayed"" without specifying any timings. The tracking in the app was unavailable, which made the waiting process even more stressful. | Finally, after waiting all that time, which made it so that no other bus was available (as the 21:30 bus was the last for flixbus and the others were fully booked), the only compensation for the stress was a refund. | No more trains were available at that time and the subway was shut. | Needed to be back to Bristol the day after for a flight, so had no option to stay for the night.

Flixbus UK,"Drivers need more training and must speak English coherently,",1,,2024-12-02T10:11:49.000Z,"The drivers spoke little English, could not interact with passengers and were unfriendly. We arrived at 1.15pm and were refused help into our paid seat, the drivers apparently having told passengers to sit anywhere. We had to sit in a broken seat at the front. They initially refused us onto the bus saying we had too much luggage. We were actually one 20kg case light. They said the luggage was full and refused a passenger before us, only letting her on when my daughter intervened. There was half a luggage compartment free. Two ladies arrived two minutes late as the bus was about to leave and the drivers refused them. One of the ladies stood in front of the bus so the driver started the engine and moved forward as if to knock her over. Passengers at the front were shouting. I was told to walk through passport control without my wheelchair and customs officers told me I should have stayed on the bus. Seat belts were not checked. Announcements comprised of a few words and were ineligible. The driver did not tell the ferry people he had to access wheelchairs, was guided close to the wall and as a result could not fully open the luggage compartment, dragged my wheelchair out and the nut and bolt for the brake went flying.

I waited until 3:00 and decided to call and ask what was happening the lady on the phone pretty much told me I was lying and that they showed up on time so they couldn’t help out and left me stranded even thought their own bus driver told me to wait.

Then after waiting at the bus stop I decided to leave. 2 hours later I got an email saying it was delayed. I phoned customer service stating with no warning I lost my hotel room because flix didn't give me enough time to sort that out. So I lost money for the hotel and never made it to my destination. While the other companies were telling their customers they can get the train for free. While flix didn't put out any notice. Absolute joke and will never use them again as this is the 3rd time this has happened where flix just doesn't update on what's happening.

The first time a delay cause missed connection, Customer Services will never refund any part, to put something right. | This time I had a booking problem before I even got on the bus... | I was booking a ticket at £37, it showed pending on my card, but then transaction 'error' message and I never got ticket. | I tried again at £42, 'error' | Tried 3rd time, it worked but then the price was £53 ! | Transactions 1&2 were in a 10minute hold window, artificially rising the price when the third purchase attempt worked. | Even though the extra demand was Me, Me & Me, I paid £15 more than if they hadn't reversed the first attempt. |  | I spoke to Customer Services who said 'this happens with their system', and absolutely wont refund down to first price. Even though tickets now are £37 again, as the other 2 transactions have timed out. |  | Whether this is a deliberate scam, or just a bug that Flixbus benefit from, the fact is they dont care. |  | Flixbus have useless customer relations, and will just fob people off. Its a complete, infuriating, waste of time. They should be held to account. |  | Edit: I emailed Customer services again, telling them what happened, with screenshots, and they replied with an obtuse and factually incorrect non-answer. The reply did not address the point I was showing them. | They also suggested that a number of people may have booked tickets and then cancelled them straight after, all within my sequential booking attempts. An implausible 'fob off' that just makes you feel worse. | Some of the time Flixbus journeys can be ok but if Flixbus could be responsive when things go wrong it would be much better. | They almost have a monopoly on some routes, but I will try and find an alternative because of the way the customer service are :("

The bus collection time was changed 3 times, once going from Victoria to Brugge and twice on the way back. It ran 2 hours late. | The coach was filthy. Rubbish on the seats and floor. We were advised not to use the toilet as it was full. There was urine all over the toilet floor. There were two drivers for both journeys, on both occasions they were so rude and were bullying towards the passengers. there was limited information given so for example when we boarded the ferry the microphone went on and the driver said 5C. That was it no other words.If English was not your first language you had no way of knowing what they meant. I had to help the other passengers. | Pay a bit extra and go with another company!!! | You have been warned."

Flixbus UK,"What's with dynamic style pricing for seats, SHOCKING",1,,2024-11-26T15:10:31.000Z,"Not something I do very often however I do feel I need to express my opinion this matter. |  | Use Flix bus they say, it's so cheap compared to other operators. But the whole truth from someone who travels up and down from Scotland every week racking up 1000 every week on the bus. I feel that the information from Flix Bus is very misleading and is only appropriate when you buy your ticket 2 months in advance. However when you look to book a bus at short notice you get hugely stung and have to in some cases pay 3 times the original fair. This is dynamic pricing and is not fair on Customers. In times of austerity where people live week to week, I find this very unfair. The feeling that is received is that Flix Bus would rather have an open seat or have someone pay 2/3 times the price and in many cases these are for longer journeys where you may have to change bus. So instead of a 9hr journey from Scotland to London will take 12hrs due to having to change bus. |  | For a student who travels from Scotland to London every week, my view is that many public transport companies pry on the vulnerability of its customers and their need to get from A to B. |  | Since September I have chosen to travel Via Mega Bus on sheer value on booking buses at shorter notice. |  | I will also conclude that this will not be something that will be addressed on the near future or anytime in the future. FLIX bus will simply run by numbers and dynamic pricing for seats on their buses will remain the same. Let's see how much the price increase reaches by this time next year."

On arrival the departure board was not showing a 12pm Flixbus which was the departure time on our ticket. After finding a Flixbus rep via the Megabus customer service, we were told the departure time had changed and the bus had left. The next departure was at 1.30pm and we could get on that if (repeat if) there was room. Not willing to take that risk and also wait nearly 2hrs, we decided to board a Megabus which was leaving at 12pm, this cost us £20 each.

Flixbus UK,Great value and comfortable way to travel,5,,2024-11-18T17:33:58.000Z,"I travelled to Paris from Birmingham with my wife and 11 year old daughter for a few days in the half term holiday. We'd never considered using a bus for this sort of journey before but the flights were expensive and inconvenient, and the trains even more so. | The journey was great - all the buses were near enough on time, and apart from the appalling state of Paris Bercy coach station (Victoria is loads nicer), the journey was very comfortable. There were a few issues - only one of the four buses had the advertised WiFi, and the driver of the Paris-London leg decided that seat reservations didn't apply on his bus. I contacted customer services when I got back though, and they refunded the cost of the seat reservation without any hassle so that was fine. We still got to sit together, just not where we'd booked, unlike the train. Plus I had to drive to Birmingham from mid-Wales to catch the bus in the first place but that's because of where we live. | All in though, great value, comfortable and reliable - we'd definitely do it again. Now if Flixbus could bring themselves to come to mid-Wales, now that Megabus have pulled out of Aberystwyth, everything would be perfect."

Due to an accident, my transatlantic was cut short and I wound up with a couple of days extra in the UK. I looked at airfare and at nearly $500.00, more than I could afford. For under $50.00, I booked a round trip ride on a comfortable coach. I highly recommend using Flixbus."

Flixbus UK,Catalogue of poor service,1,,2024-11-16T22:48:30.000Z,I took the bus on a return from Birmingham to Paris. I originally booked Bristol to Paris and to change it was cheaper to buy a new ticket for the amended leg as they won’t change part of a ticket. |  | They then got back two hours late Paris to London resulting in me missing my connection and refuse to pay the compensation I’m entitled to under their terms and conditions. The bus was late due to the driver delaying things unnecessarily and it had two huge cracks on the front windscreen. |  | The customer service is appalling and they refuse accountability! Even lieing about their delays.

Flixbus UK,Unreliable comes to mind .,1,,2024-11-12T15:05:51.000Z,"Unreliable comes to mind or sums up this excuse of a Coach Company . Booked tickets well in advance to pick up me and my partner from Nottingham to take us direct to Heathrow Airport. Thought because of their magnificent advertising we were confident that our transport to Heathrow was 100% especially as we were flying to the Philippines the same day . On the evening before we were to travel on FlixBus around 9pm my partner whilst checking her emails,noticed there was an email from FlixBus saying they had cancelled the coach with no explanation or alternative , might I hasten to add we were to board the bus at 2am leaving us with 5 hours to organise alternative/ reliable transport being National Express. | FlixBus stated that they would compensate us for up to the value of a second class train ticket . To date we haven’t been compensated even after following their protocol of sending them the invoice . | My conclusion of this company if getting to your destination is important don’t use this coach company so AVOID!"
Flixbus UK,Ridiculous experience,1,,2024-11-12T14:33:39.000Z,"I had a ridiculous experience from Birmingham to Bristol on 9/11/24. My bus was delayed by 45 mins, the bus finally arrived at 6:30pm. The ticket shows travel time is 1 hr 55 mins. The driver drive in to Gloucester Service Southbound at 8:10pm. It just 36 mins (32mi) away to destination (Bristol bus station). Driver told us he needs take 45 mins break and the bus will resume at 9:00pm. OMG!!!!!!! It totally unfair for all customers take a long break with driver and unacceptable. | Of course, if driver feeling unwell or bus technical issue need to cool down, I fully understand the situation. However, I don't think any issues happened. | How ridiculous the driver need to take 45 mins break for just 2 hrs journey. If I need to catch the other bus or flight who to bear this delay? | If 45 mins break per every trip (no matter the distance) is your company policy for driver, you should included into the travel time, customer can aware the total travel time. | Finally, I spent total 4 hours for 87mi! !!!!!!"
Flixbus UK,Poor customer service and uncomfortable travel conditions,1,,2024-11-12T08:32:15.000Z,"**Trustpilot Review for FlixBus** |  | Rating: ★☆☆☆☆ |  | I had a terrible experience with FlixBus and would not recommend it to anyone. My bus was delayed by over an hour, and FlixBus did a poor job informing passengers about what was happening. I was left stranded at an outdoor bus stop in 6°C weather at 11 pm with no update, shelter, or support from the company. |  | When the bus finally arrived, both the driver and the assistant were rude and dismissive. Neither spoke English, which made it impossible to ask any questions or get help. The bus was freezing inside with no blankets provided, making the already uncomfortable situation even worse. To top it off, the driver played loud music throughout the night, which could be heard even on the upper deck, making it impossible to get any rest. |  | This was one of the worst travel experiences I’ve ever had. If you’re considering FlixBus, be aware of their lack of communication, poor customer service, and uncomfortable travel conditions. I strongly recommend looking at other options, such as train (even if there are 2-3 changes)."

Got on the Flix bus service UK-N11 from Edinburgh to Aberdeen on the 12th of October 2024. On getting to Aberdeen later than scheduled time. In a hurry to meet up with my next bus to Portlethen, I accidentally left my luggage in the bus luggage compartment. On realizing my error, i dashed back to the bus stance but the bus driver had just shut the door and about to begin his manoeuvre. He didn't even acknowledge me despite my yelling and chasing the bus. Immediately reported the missing luggage to Flixbus. Didn't get a response until 12 days later saying they had found my luggage and it was safe at one of their depots. Responded immediately wit the required information. Fast forward to 8 days later, i got an email saying they don't have my luggage. Called the customer service a couple of time and i must say the customer service representatives are the most appalling, clueless and useless reps ever. No idea of their company product, processes and no understanding of their job roles. One had the Audacity to hang up the call after yelling at me. Its been emails after emails to the Lost and found email address, with no response. Lets not mention the losses i'm having to count and the mental torture their shambolic service has caused myself and my family. We have offered to drive down to whatever depot the luggage is been held to retrieve it but they have refused to give details. | I'll be taking my time and give the a month after which i'll be taking legal action against them.

What should have been a simple journey from Middlesbrough to London turned into a traumatic ordeal due to the behavior of the crew. |  | The bus was 30 minutes late, leaving my relative and me waiting outside at midnight in near-freezing conditions. The bus stop itself was just a local stop, with no shelter to protect us from the cold, wind, or potential rain, and there were no toilet facilities. We were both freezing and uncomfortable by the time the bus arrived, and I asked a simple question about the delay and how long we’d need to wait to board. |  | To my surprise, the female driver responded with aggression and outright hostility. She shouted at me, telling me that she was ""the boss"" and that she didn’t need to answer my questions. Her attitude quickly escalated, and she even threatened not to let me on the bus. I tried to explain that I had a connecting flight to catch, but when I stood at the bus entrance, the driver and her colleague blocked my way, attempting to shut the door in my face. At that moment, I genuinely feared for my safety, feeling vulnerable, humiliated, and deeply unsettled. Being verbally attacked, physically blocked from boarding the bus, and made to feel vulnerable in such a dangerous situation has left me with serious concerns about my safety when traveling with FlixBus |  | In the end, I had no choice but to apologize repeatedly just to be allowed on board. This behavior was not just unfriendly—it was abusive and entirely unprofessional. |  | As someone with a traumatic disorder, the incident left me shaken and in tears for much of the journey. This was an appalling experience, especially for my first trip with FlixBus. I had heard positive things about their service in other countries, but my experience in the UK has been anything but reassuring. |  | I have since reached out to FlixBus, hoping they’ll take serious action to prevent similar incidents in the future. If you’re planning to travel with FlixBus, especially in the UK, please be aware that customer service and accountability may not meet expectations, as my experience has shown."

I downloaded the app which is extremely simple to use. I had no issues booking tickets. The bus stops were easy to find and the coaches were smooth and reasonably comfortable. We stopped halfway on the journey at the services for a toilet break. Visiting Lisbon was amazing and I would recommend it to everyone. You can buy a day pass/ticket for the trains, trams and busses for around 6.80 euro in the station below the bus depot. This will get you everywhere. The only struggle I had was which side to get on the transport in Lisbon. The information available is very difficult to understand. Don't be afraid to ask the Portuguese are very helpful and speak good English."

The driver’s behavior was appalling—rude and unprofessional from the start. Midway through the trip, he abruptly stopped the bus and started yelling at passengers about using their phones, creating a tense and uncomfortable atmosphere. He targeted a young Chinese woman specifically, making offensive, racist comments, and attempted to mock her conversation. The driver appeared exhausted, as though he hadn’t slept in days, and his aggressive demeanor only heightened the anxiety on board. This kind of treatment is unacceptable, and I sincerely hope FlixBus addresses this issue to ensure future passengers aren’t subjected to such disrespectful behavior."

Refused boarding. |  | Reason: nothing wrong with my ticket, they had just decided not to stop at Ghent and Den Haag (even though it was still up there on the bus 'header'). Without informing me and the six other people with perfectly valid tickets. Took ages for the Flixbus people at the station to find this out, because they had not been told in advance either. Fundamental, appalling, incompetent and insane non-service, |  | Their 'excuse'? 'Operational reasons'. The email came in 20 minutes after the bus left the terminal. Can't even spell 'cancellation' properly. |  | The remedies? Wait until the evening bus (delaying my trip by many many hours when already I had waited hours without sleep), get a full refund, and/or take 2nd class train, that I pay for up front and then wait on them to reimburse me. As if I believe they ever would. |  | I'm a (now very tired) female old age pensioner! For sure I'm going do my best to make them pay for this chaos and discomfort."

Outstanding service! Seats were really comfy, could recline, and all had usb sockets, very clean, perfect temperature, WiFi, surprised how low price they are for the level of service and comfort you get compared to other bus companies. Also used the service Vejle to Copenhagen and bus was great. Will be using Flix bus as my go-to for travel from now on. 5 star 🌟"

Flixbus UK,First trip. Good experience.,4,,2024-10-27T12:43:07.000Z,Was overall very pleased with my recent trip Paris to Lisbon. Seats are a bit small particularly when seat in front reclines but comfortable too. Was content too with temperature control. The bus is kept at a lower temperature which is much better than being too warm. Four stops en route for a comfort break and well timed. One stop for 35 minutes allowed for hot food. Good value for money and no baggage restrictions as I could see. Would use again for long distance travel. Cuts airport hassle and I enjoyed the scenery too for such trips.

It was everything fine to Dundee but from there it was horrible. The driver took up some young people, between age 12-17 and they had a really bad behaviour. They was smoking and drinking all that way, and having party with music and shouting all the way. It was horrible to watch it with my 6 year old son,who was really tired and couldn't sleep because of it. And the driver didn't even try to speak with them. It was really sad.

Had our short breaks to get off the bus which is helpful to change the routine & get some leg stretches and fresh air. To add, each person has a place to put their feet higher which helps the blood flow of the legs, that's another good health consideration they've put into their high standards of comfort which I absolutely loved those extra touches."

Flixbus UK,Appalling experience,1,,2024-10-24T08:39:03.000Z,"What a shocking experience. Astounded that such a vehicle is allowed on the roads. Non functioning toilet in a dilapidated bus that should have been removed off the roads long ago. Not a single functioning power / USB point, tray tables loose and not maintained, seats could not adjust, and then mechanical issues with the vehicle too. And it arrives two hours late, so you miss your connecting travel. And Flixbus' standard response - you boarded the bus, so no refund or any compensation. How are you supposed to make alternative plans after you were supposed to depart? Zero ""delay repay"" type of compensation. Like what else are you supposed to do - you're at your departure point and then get told 30 mins after you were supposed to leave that the bus will be there in a further hour's time. Appalling company. Completely unreliable. And don't bother making plans at all at your destination until such time as you actually arrive as they are always late, and usually by 2 or more hours."

Flixbus UK,It may be cheaper at first but it's a false economy purchase,1,,2024-10-23T15:22:52.000Z,"First time to use the Flixbus and due to this I made sure I was at the location early as informed using the 'what 3 words' on the app. I waited and both the Newcastle and London bus pulled in at the specified spot which is a pull in at a Hotel in Leeds. However, no sight of the Bristol Bus. I asked the driver of the London if he had any update as nothing came up on the app to advise. He didn't have a clue. It was after that another couple of people waiting for the bus advised that apparently the bus stopped across the busy road rather than the designated area and had already left. This left me stranded on a Sunday. There is no option to speak to anyone as the Flixbus offices are closed at weekend. So at a huge expense I had to find an alternative to travel the 200 plus miles to get home. On Monday the reply was 'other people got on'. Where is the checking, obviously I was expecting it to come where the other buses were pulling into? Nobody came over or yelled out for Bristol. I do not wish to use again and would expect the fare to be refunded but they are refusing. Save your money, this bus company is a false economy. Worst customer service, it's cheap for a reason."

Flixbus UK,Worst company experience,1,,2024-10-20T22:32:02.000Z,"Per the last review I left the company got upset I guarantee. Can't tell me otherwise that you don't do that my experience was genuine as were the people waiting there for hours for no real explanation then the Driver never showed up and I did wait for 8 hours. You were not there and you cannot claim that other wise. |  | They can get all upset that they want. This company is completely mismanaged and this was the US not sure how the UK varies but it must be better there. Greyhound owns them in the US I guess and the whole experience was a nightmare and just gross negligence on part of the company, The people who work the bus stop are not at fault it's the policies for the drivers. Do better and maybe don't think a review is unrealistic because FlixBus is trying to save face. Yes just bow to corporate interests who cares what the customer thinks right? |  | I would give no stars but that's not possible...."

Flixbus UK,I didn't had a good experience,2,,2024-10-20T10:40:25.000Z,"I didn't had a good experience. | First when I went to the bus stop, the bus was on the other side of the station, when I approached the bus driver told me I had to pic up on the other side, what it was okay by me. | When he move bus to stance G he opened the door asked for the last 3 number of certain booking but never asked for my booking number. | I had to go and show him and frown at me, the I had a small bag in my hand with 4 cinnamon pretzel he asked what I had in the bag I told him what it was, then he asked if I have anything else aside from the pretzel, liquids or other stuff. | I responded no. | Then he proceed to open my bag without asking, when I look at his face is stopped. He had no right to do that especially without asking my permission to search my bag. I felt I was racially profiled. But didn't said anything. | I went up the stairs an most of the front seat was unoccupied, so I decided to seat In the front row of seat on the left side near to window and nearly beside the driver, because I like to enjoy the view and because was no one there I thought why not? | As soon everyone was inside the bus driver came in side of the bus an in a rude way asked me, what I was doing there and very sure was not the number I have been placed when I bought the ticket, so for me to leave the place go and seat at number place that I was allocated. I could see the racism on the tone of is voice, and the disgust in is face. | I was in shock. | How can a human being trate another human like this? | This his appalling that we are In twenty first century and we still people thinking they are superior than others because of their colour skin or their religion. I don't know, but that is ludicrous, yes it is. | But well what can the company do? | Maybe a back ground check perhaps would make a significant. | So people will not be in this situation."

Flixbus UK,Not reliable poor service and refund and compensation policy,1,,2024-10-20T07:52:50.000Z,How on earth has this company got 4.5 DO NOT USE THIS BUS SERVICE.. my reason for being as follows I booked a return ticket to go to London Gatwick airport at 1.20am on 30th September as I was going away with my wife the bus came at the time started we got on the coach but that’s as far as we got. The driver said there was nobody to take over the driving and the next bus would come for me and my wife and other passengers at 4.30 well that’s no good to me there are now trains at 1.45 at this time and had no other way to get to the airport a taxi would have cost from Newport wales to London Gatwick would have cost a fortune so I rang around friends must who had work at 8am mana to get a friend to give us a lift cost £100 petrol managed to get to the airport for our flight and enjoy our holiday. We came back what a surprise the bus was late but at least I got home I rang up customer service after 7 attempts trying to get through on their automated phone system and spoke to a man who was no help at all after me telling him what happened and that I had to pay £100 petrol to a friend to take me to the airport so I don’t loose my holiday I asked for a refund for my ticket and compensation for the petrol I had to pay and was told I due to company policy I would only get £24 seriously.. SO EVERYONE YES ITS CHEAP BUT IS IT WORTH BEING LATE FOR A MEETING OR GOING TO THE AIRPORT OR JUST TO GO SOMEWHERE AND IT DONT TURN UP ITS NOT USE NATIONAL EXPRESS
Flixbus UK,Punctual and affordable,5,,2024-10-20T17:50:32.000Z,"From Arlanda to Stockholm Central | The bus came on time, the driver was friendly and helpful putting luggage in the hold | It was very cheap which was very affordable | I couldn’t see any signage with the WiFi information.

Flixbus UK,The worst customer service imaginable,1,,2024-10-18T18:14:11.000Z,"On the basis of our experience you should avoid FlixBus like the plague! We booked tickets from A Coruña to Pontevedra, for a service operated by their ""partner"", Monbus due to leave at 10:00. On the day of travel we received messages about the bus being delayed. but these were never updated to indicate that the bus was approaching/arriving at A Coruña. Worse, the link FlixBus sent that claimed to show the ""live"" location of the bus never showed it getting anywhere near A Coruña! Nevertheless, we waited at the designated departure bay. A MonBus bus, displaying a Pontevedra destination, arrived at those bays - and its driver promptly left the bus without saying anything to the queue of passengers. | While the driver was away another MonBus bus pulled into the arrival bays, discharged passengers, moved elswhere (not into any of the departure bays!) and shortly afterwards left the bus station. | When the driver returned to the bus in the departure bay and we presented our ticket she said that hers was the 11:15 departure and she couldn't accept our tickets (she SEEMED to say that this was because they were issued by FlixBus, but language difficulties mean 'm not certain about this). She insisted we bought new tickets in order to make our journey. | On taking this up with FlixBus they insisted they could do nothing about it and we would have to take the matter up directly with MonBus. | Note that despite the journey being on a relatively busy Saturday morning, there were no FlixBus or MonBus staff in evidence at the bus station, no passenger information apart from a departure board in the main waiting concourse (which is on a higher level than the departure/arrival bays), and no passenger announcements. | It seems that FlixBus's attitude to customer service is that they'll happily take your money, and if all goes well they'll take the credit. But if anything goes wrong they'll wash their hands of you!"
Flixbus UK,"Closed washroom, bad wifi, more stops",2,,2024-10-18T15:58:07.000Z,Washroom was closed and there were at least two more stops than noted on my itinerary. The lady sitting beside me was going to miss her train as a result. Wifi didn’t work for the last half of the trip. Not what I expected at all. Driver was also a bit condescending.
Flixbus UK,I took the flixbus from Porto airport…,4,,2024-10-18T15:24:02.000Z,I took the flixbus from Porto airport to Vila Real and the experience was a good one apart from a couple of minor irritations. The bus itself was clean and comfortable. The ticket booked online incredibly cheap and the driver polite and helpful. The bus was a little later than expected but that's no big deal to me as one would expect occasional delays in a big city. Arrival at Vila Real was as expected pretty much on time. My ticket seemed to have a seat number that didn't exist which may have been an issue if the bus had more passengers. I also was unable to connect to the WiFi network on board which in a way I was thankful for because it meant I spent more time looking out of the window at some stunning landscapes. Other people who use the Internet more may have found this a bigger irritation. All in all a good experience and I would use flixbus again.

Flixbus UK,Extremely Disappointing Experience with FlixBus,1,,2024-10-15T13:36:48.000Z,"I recently traveled on FlixBus from London Finchley Road(Stop CL) to Newcastle upon Tyne on 14/10/2024 at 08:00 AM (bus plate number: SG24 UGO) and had a deeply disappointing experience. My seat number was 2A, and unfortunately, the journey was marred by the unprofessional behavior of a staff member. |  | After departing from Luton, a passenger behind me, who turned out to be a driver’s assistant, aggressively shook my seat and rudely shouted at me, claiming I was pushing my seat too far back. His hostile tone left me shocked and stressed for the rest of the trip. Rather than simply moving to the empty seat next to him, he chose to confront me in an unacceptable manner. |  | This individual had been assisting passengers with their luggage in Sheffield and Leeds, and his aggressive behavior is not what I expect from FlixBus staff. I felt uncomfortable and unable to relax throughout the journey. |  | As a result of this incident, I will not be using FlixBus services again. It is a shame to have staff members with such a mentality working for a company that should prioritize customer comfort and safety. I hope FlixBus takes this feedback seriously and implements necessary training for their staff."

I was refused a refund and when I called back the next day they told me the coach arrived at 9:30, so a different time. So I’m being given different information each time I try find out what happened. The next flix bus wasn’t until 11:55 so I had to book myself onto a mega bus which cost £25 so it cost me £30 to get back to Leeds via coach.

Flixbus UK,Never use Flixbus!!!,1,,2024-10-08T21:36:08.000Z,"Never use this company, never! I had not nice experience before, but this time was complete disaster!!! First my bus was delayed. Imagine, they wrote me 29 min before my bus that it will come about 1h late. But then...the bus came 2,5h later and I missed my connection. Another story: the bus was coming 30 minutes earlier and the driver decided to stop for 15 min at expensive café and as a result we came 10 min later than the schedule. But the last drop was: I've asked the office in advance about stopping at the border just to put the custom stamp. They said, yes the bus will stop. I've asked the driver and then his colleague about the stop and both at the same time said yes. And do you know what?! Nobody stopped!!! The worst service I ever had!!!"
Flixbus UK,Avoid FlixBus at All Costs! Horrible Service and Rude Drivers,1,,2024-10-08T19:19:09.000Z,"I’m absolutely disgusted by the experience I had with FlixBus and the way they handled my complaint. A few days ago, while waiting at the Broxden Park & Ride, I mistakenly boarded a bus headed for Aberdeen. The driver’s reaction? Completely rude and dismissive! Instead of a polite response to a simple question, I was met with a condescending and aggressive tone, embarrassing me in front of other passengers. And when I reached out to customer service to report this unprofessional behavior, I received a generic, computer-generated response that did nothing to address the issue. Clearly, FlixBus doesn’t care how their customers are treated. |  | I’ve used FlixBus multiple times in the past, but let’s be honest, the only reason I tolerated their poor service was the cheap price. The internet never works, the toilets are often out of service, and the buses themselves are filthy. I could overlook these things for a budget-friendly trip, but dealing with rude, disrespectful employees is where I draw the line. |  | I’ve deleted the app and will never use FlixBus again. If you’re traveling in Scotland, I highly recommend Ember, which offers a far better and more professional service. Do yourself a favor and avoid FlixBus—it’s simply not worth the trouble."

My advise is to use another service if your trip is time sensitive as time keeping is a major issue with this company. I missed all appointments scheduled that day and had to spend an extra night and reschedule my return ticket, all of which increased my travel costs.

Flixbus UK,Absolutely outstanding customer service,5,,2024-09-30T14:44:04.000Z,"Absolutely outstanding customer service. I need to travel from Cardiff to Paris and am a wheelchair user. I spoke to them and they said after I booked my ticket, they would send me one for my carer for free. They registered my wheelchair and let their traffic control department know they had a disabled traveller. Cannot rate them highly enough."
Flixbus UK,Comfortable service and very relaxed,5,,2024-09-30T13:31:05.000Z,Comfortable service and very relaxed. I usually use for football trip and it’s a good way to travel for the games.
Flixbus UK,Unwilling to accept fault,1,,2024-09-30T12:56:04.000Z,"Spoke to agent online, was told 'no/minimal difference to ticket price' if purchasing on bus as opposed to website. Cool I thought, was worried about missing bus as it's super early and local buses to station aren't reliable. Arrived early in the end, 1st in queue. As boarding began 10 mins before departure, was asked to step aside because I wanted to purchase ticket from driver, so he boarded everyone else first. Ten mins pass, departure time now passed. Proceeded to get charged double price, despite incorrect info from online agent, and also by driver who said if I'd bought it when he first saw me aka before departure time, I could have still bought it online for the cheaper price. Annoying, but figured customer service would see the issue. Nope. They said 'cannot help as contract between customer and company complete' because I took the bus that I needed to get to the airport to catch my flight. So essentially got lied to, charged double and ultimately screwed over. Will not recommend and will never use again because of this. Use Megabus or National Express instead."

Clearly they hadn’t sold enough seats so just cancelled. They don’t care, don’t try to help, just offer you a paltry refund. Alternatives very expensive as last minute but FlixBus has no proper UK-based support so unable and unwilling to assist. Don’t risk booking with this lot - totally unreliable."

However, our return bus on Sunday got cancelled. No notification sent on the app. Only an email two hours before our journey was sent. When we realised, it was too late to book the next bus. Next two buses were fully booked. It cost us a lot to get another bus ticket from a different company. Our return was very stressful rushing around to get another company ticket.

So we did everything right. As I’m tracking the live location of the bus, it looks as if it’s going a different route to what was planned and arrives on the OPPOSITE SIDE of the road. Keep in mind, that the street we had to run across was extremely busy and not so easy to cross in such a short moment. Thank goodness we were lucky and had the chance to run across the road without cars, because otherwise we would’ve missed our bus. This induced an awful lot of anxiety :/"

Flixbus UK,Wrong information on departure boards,3,,2024-09-28T16:20:24.000Z,"When I arrived at the departure station the information boards had the wrong information showing. They were showing that the bus time was either 6:10 or 9:10 although everyone waiting had a ticket stating that the bus was due to leave at 7:10. It got to 7:00 and the bus hadn't arrived and we started to think that we had missed our bus although we had all been there way before the time on our tickets. Another passenger tried to call the help desk and was immediately cut off. When a different flixbus turned up we asked the driver if he knew what time the bus was due and he said 9:10 which would have meant some people would miss their flights. When the bus did arrive at 7:20 it turned out that he'd had a puncture and had to change buses, but it would have been much more helpful if the times on the information board was correct in the first place."

Price was £67 in total as opposed to over £130 on the train. | So much easier too, no lugging your cases on and off trains when you have to change. The coach was comfy, loo was clean, driver kept to time. Overall excellent service and will definitely use again. Did return journey from Swansea to Gatwick , all the drivers were very pleasant, called out every stop clearly and often multiple times, very professional and remained calm even when passengers hadn’t listened and missed their stop! | Only thing that would have made it better would be a vending machine selling water and or snacks (6.5 hours is a long time on a coach if you haven’t had opportunity to get some in advance, e.g. flight lands late) | I highly recommend Flix Bus to anyone.

The outward journey was 40-45 mins late, and the return journey was cancelled altogether and there were no other Flix buses leaving that day from that particular bus staition. Due to the late arrival, I had to pay for a taxi to get to my meeting and due to the cancellation, I had to buy an expensive on the day ticket from a different bus company to get home. Hopeless, unreliable and expensive, if you include the costs of fixing their failures. The Flix tickets costs less than £10, but to fix their failures cost more than £22, and many hours of my time. I would not use this company again."
Flixbus UK,Awful service. Avoid!,1,,2024-11-11T22:29:45.000Z,Awful service should something go wrong.

Flixbus UK,"Fare cheap, so the service and behaviour, all are cheap",1,,2024-09-22T01:37:05.000Z,"I have already submitted a review about the delay of your service on the 20th of September 2024. I was scheduled to board the 6:05 PM bus from Birmingham to Victoria, London, and I had expressed my concern about missing my connecting bus at 10 PM from London to Colchester. | Unfortunately, that bus arrived approximately an hour late. When I showed the driver (Bus 030) my booking, he attempted to scan the QR code from my soft copy but immediately told me it was not a valid ticket after just one attempt. He refused to scan it again and told me I was not allowed to travel, stating I did not have a valid ticket. Without further explanation, he went inside the bus and sat in the driver’s seat, preparing to close the door. | I was panicked and frightened. As an international student unfamiliar with this country, I feared what would happen if I missed my next bus—where would I stay for the night in an unknown city? I repeatedly tried to convince the driver by showing him the email copy of my ticket. I placed my luggage on the second step of the bus and stood on the first step, leaning inside to request that he not leave without me, as I had a valid ticket. Despite my pleas, the driver (white, stocky build, around 5’7” to 5’9” with an oval-shaped face, as far as I remember) came over, grabbed my luggage, and forced me off the bus while using inappropriate language and a rude tone (the CCTV footage will provide evidence of this interaction). | He then closed the door and drove off, leaving me distressed and stranded. | Thankfully, there were several other passengers and bystanders waiting for the next FlixBus to London and Manchester. Many of them were upset on my behalf and tried to console me, assuring me that they would speak to the next driver. While they were supporting me, someone suggested I contact customer service. I attempted to do so, but my phone battery was running low, and I had to disconnect the call to save enough charge to check my travel details. I asked my daughter to call on my behalf, and she tried three times. On each occasion, customer service promised to call back after 30 minutes, but they never followed through. | After about half an hour, the next bus arrived. Both the passengers and bystanders explained my situation to the driver (tall, stout, of African origin), and he assured me he would sort it out after checking all the tickets. Once he had completed that, he kindly allowed me to board and told me he would drop me off at Victoria Coach Station. I was incredibly grateful for the kindness of the passengers and this driver (CCTV footage will confirm this as well). I boarded the bus and began my journey to London. | However, due to the delay, I arrived 20 minutes late and missed my connecting bus to Colchester. I approached the FlixBus night service personnel at Victoria Coach Station and explained everything that had happened, but I was told there were no bus service to Colchester by Flixbus. I was advised to purchase another ticket for a 2:40 AM (National Express bus service)bus on the 21st of September. With no other option, I had to ask my daughter to buy me another ticket online. | As an international student on a tight budget, these unexpected expenses were a huge burden. On top of the new bus fare, I had to spend additional money on food while I waited for the next bus, and these costs were not part of my planned expenses. | I am requesting a full refund for all the extra costs I incurred due to the inappropriate behavior of your driver, including the additional bus fare and other related expenses. I also expect an explanation of the driver’s conduct and steps that will be taken to ensure this doesn’t happen to anyone else. CCTV footage will back up my account, and I believe the testimonies of my fellow passengers will do the same. | While I am grateful for the help of the second driver and the other passengers, I should not have been treated this way by the first driver. I urge FlixBus to review this situation with empathy and provide a fair resolution. | I look forward to your prompt response and action. | This was not the first incident. On the 26th of August 2024, while waiting at 7 AM to catch a FlixBus to London, I received an email early in the morning informing me that my bus had been canceled. The original bus was scheduled to depart at 9 AM from London to Leeds. Instead, FlixBus rebooked me on a bus at 1:30 PM the same day. On that occasion as well, I had to spend extra money on food due to the extended waiting time. I didn’t file a complaint at the time, but now that this is happening again, it has become extremely distressing and frightening, especially for international students who often have to travel for essential reasons."
Flixbus UK,Poor experience with Flixbus,1,,2024-09-21T22:27:12.000Z,"We booked 4 tickets to travel from Bristol Airport to Bridgend (South Wales) leaving @2.20pm on 21/09/24. | Having landed at 11.40am we had a bit of a wait ahead of us, so we got to the bus stop 20 mins before the bus was due to depart. We were then informed that the bus had already departed (25 mins early) without informing us, so we had to rebook for 4 new tickets on the next bus and wait in the airport for another 3 hours ! This bus company can't be relied on, so be aware when you book to travel with them, i suppose you get what you pay for."

Negatives ..I can only refer to my experience from Brussels to Bruges the signposting needs improving by making them clear as there was 3 bus stands .don't use the same bus number for different locations it confuses people. If you reserve a seat the driver should identify those seats instead of leaving the passengers to ask them to move. People don't queue when the bus arrives which can be dangerous if there are older people around.
Flixbus UK,lying thieves,1,,2024-09-21T19:47:45.000Z,"The coach to London was three hours late, so there was no point in using it, and as the coach was over two hours late I was told I could get a full refund. I was then told two weeks later that I was entitled to a refund as I'd taken the coach. They know this is not true as they have CCTV on their coaches. And, no matter how many times I tell them that I wasn't on the coach and that I can prove it with CCTV footage that I was in Sheffield, and transactions that day based in Sheffield, and eye witnesses that I was Sheffield, they tell me that these aren't proof that I didn't take the coach, that I was supposed to wait three hours and declare to the coach driver that I wasn't going to take the trip. Each rep I speak to gives me a different excuses, and takes 2 weeks to answer basic questions. They say there is a list of reasons they accept for a refund, but they don't divulge them or give access to them to help my case. They are lying thieves."

There was no incentive to get off and no guarantee that we would get a seat on the next bus, we were made to sit for over an hour with no update, eventually a taxi was arranged for the extra passengers, why couldn't they do this at the beginning?!?! The driver said we could claim compensation, I tried and was told no...My return journey also arrived late by one hour without any explanation!...Flixbus need to have a process in place to sort out this kind of issue and also train drivers to not make passengers feel like it is their fault!

Also, in the event of advance cancellation, the policies are far too tough. Offering 30% refund wih vouchers is unacceptable; I personally don't have Flix bus available where I live.

Flixbus UK,Took bus from London to Glasgow,3,,2024-09-10T16:36:02.000Z,Took bus from London to Glasgow. Roadworks just before Glasgow so diverted off motorway. Thankfully the spare diver was there as the driver got very stressed with the awful road conditions which were very foggy and very twisty roads. The driver was cursing a lot which I didn't like being behind him. Also at a roundabout the spare driver told him to take a right and the driver was about to actually turn right approaching the roundabout!!!

Got a delayed notification to say that the connection would be 90 minutes late. (The bus had just left Inverness) | This would make me miss my appointment and I complained to Flixbus. Apparently if its under 2 hours, no refund is due. Be very careful about this company, only book with them if you want to lose your money if the bus is delayed"

Flixbus UK,Flixbus is Amazing,5,,2024-09-09T23:26:25.000Z,I love flix bus and done tons of trips with them. They are green and you can add offset to your trip for CO2 reduction. Also they are kind of like airlines around EU. No need to emit too much. And they are very well connected. Positive atmosphere and nice quality buses. The whole software system is amazing. Because it links the phone and the booking on the computer. Tickets are awesome. Lots of people are using them all the time.
Flixbus UK,Efficient & Cheap.,5,,2024-09-09T22:27:28.000Z,"Clean, modern buses ran reliably on time providing an efficient service. Far cheaper than parking a car at the airport & a greener way to travel. | I made the mistake of adding checked bagage not realising 1 per passenger was included so took 2 bags and paid for 4. My mistake, but pay attention to what you are booking."

The drivers and all staff I've met have been very personable, friendly and helpful. I'd really recommend Flix Bus and I'm looking forward to them expanding the routes."
Flixbus UK,Superb Flixbus Experience,5,,2024-09-09T18:09:32.000Z,"This was my first Flixbus experience and I am so glad I booked it before encountering negative feedback. I did a return trip between London/Antwerp/Amsterdam over two nights and a day and had a fantastic time. |  | My trip had transfers so there were four coaches. A couple of the coaches had two drivers who took turns. All the drivers were cordial and courteous. Coaches were clean and the free Wi-Fi was stable throughout. Timing was impeccable and we even saved time on the Antwerp to London journey. I booked the front seat behind the drivers because the seats had panoramic views, but they also had the most amazing legroom - far better than the space on Eurostar or any economy seat on flights. Seats were very comfortable, allowing me to take naps. I didn't use the toilets so I can't comment on those. |  | At Calais on the return trip, we were given food vouchers to exchange for free food and drinks on the ferry. I should add that although the drivers didn't have English as their first language, they managed to make announcements in English. Also, other passengers were always ready to help. Luggage-wise, suitcases obviously went in the hold, but bags and backpacks of various sizes were allowed onboard. Nothing was measured and none was rejected. Interactions with drivers were all respectful and laidback. All the seats I booked were available for my use, but I can see how they could have been taken as there was no indication of reservation. I did witness an occupant vacating a seat when asked to do so by a person with reservation. |  | Another thing, the app is very good for managing trips including cancellations and amendments. It also helps you stay updated if you have minimal access to your email. I will be booking my next trip this week. Thank you to the two female drivers on the London/Antwerp/London journey and to the gents on the Antwerp/Amsterdam journey."

Flixbus UK,Brokern heating,1,,2024-09-09T11:50:03.000Z,"The bus had broken heating. The bus driver turned on the AC, to max to ""not fall asleep"". Despite of many complaints from the passengers regarding temperature (we were all sitting with our jackets on) the driver refused to turn of the AC. When I moved to the front seat, right behind the driver, as it was a bit warmer there, she told me I have to go back to my designated seat. After I did that, more passengers moved to the front due to very low temperature and the bus driver did not mention anything to them. Not my first experience with flix bus, but definitely most dissapointing!"

The bus was on time at the departure point, which was a great start to the journey. |  | The bus itself was clean, and the seats were comfortable, providing enough legroom for a relatively pleasant trip. The onboard Wi-Fi and charging ports were a nice touch, especially for those who want to stay connected or get some work done during the journey. The driver was professional and friendly, ensuring a smooth and safe ride. |  | However, there were a few areas that could use improvement. The bus made several unscheduled stops, which slightly extended the journey time. Additionally, there could be clearer communication regarding these stops and any delays. |  | Overall, my experience with FlixBus was positive, and I would consider traveling with them again. They offer good value for money, comfortable travel, and reliable service, with just a few areas for potential improvement."

In early July, I purchased a ticket about an hour before the bus departed Liverpool back to London. After arriving at the bus stop, I met several other passengers, we received a notification that the bus had been delayed nearly 2 hours, then that the bus would be ontime, then delayed again another 2 hours. I reached out to customer support because the arrival time of the bus kept being pushed out 30 minutes, and I wanted to know if it was coming or if we needed to find another way to London. It was the middle of the night, this was not a secure bus shelter, it was outside - there were homeless people have territory fights near the shelter, no where to charge your phone. I spent nearly 2 hours trying to get answers from the Flixbus staff who continued to gaslight me and tell me the bus was coming, then tell me I had missed the bus despite me being there early and I was sitting with other passengers who had missed the bus. The agent finally told me that I could purchase a 2nd class fare train ticket to get home and I would be reimbursed. I have had back and forth communication with Flixbus since this point and they agreed to transfer me the refund but it still hasn't been transferred to me and it's been 2 months since I had to front £120 to get home, I missed a very important meeting at work, and I was completely exhausted because I had to stay awake and fight with Flixbus to get home instead of sleeping on the nightbus back to London. I was actually thinking that the refund would redeem the experience, but they continue to ignore my emails and have still not issued the refund. It's pretty unacceptable."

Flixbus UK,"A review of several tiring, wearing experiences",1,,2024-08-31T19:16:28.000Z,"This is a review of two out of about four truly terrible journeys with Flixbus recently, and I'm sure judging by some of the reviews other folks have had much worse experiences still. Now finally going to stop using them, and I should have done years ago. |  | Journey 1. | 2 hours late. There were missing seats with wires hanging out, broken chairs tied upright to the side of the coach seemingly with bin bags, no chargers, horrible toilet as usual |  | Journey 2. On this one as I write. | 2+ hours late, could be more than 3. The roof window of the bus is ""sealed"" with plastic and gaffer tape, and leaked so much earlier it filled up the seat below with a pool of water. | The driver has been on the phone twice, lifting it to his ear as he drives and driving with one hand. He waved me off, bizarrely saying it was ""hands free""! Last of all, we were made late by the first driver looking for the second driver's house in Calais for an hour, during which time we missed the ferry and became very late. |  | Some general observations. | The drivers are always amusing, and often as bemused at the general state of things as the passengers. However they are often also rude and blunt, and never communicate what's going on or update on lateness. |  | The buses are never fixed by the company. They don't care at all, only about their profit margin (which I'm amazed they even have, considering the amount of money in refunds and extra costs their inadequacy must cause them). |  | Other cheap companies do quite a lot better! National express are fine by comparison"

Minus points- the first bus’s toilet wasn’t functional- no-one could open the door, including myself. The second driver (I think they changed over at Birmingham) had to deal with a very minor bump (a medium size car tried to go through a small size car gap and knocked the coach). We were 5 minutes from London Victoria, it was close to 10pm and we were in the middle of a busy road. The driver stopped, another driver stopped, however the errant driver did not. The Flix driver kept yelling “Health and safety!”… | We were all fine, the bus had a bumper bruise. | For a while, it seemed we were doomed to forever reside in the middle of a busy urban road. There needs to be further training for dealing with minor incidents. | The second bus- first driver was excellent (from London Victoria at 11.59 on 22/08 to Plymouth); took my bag, explained where the drivers would be changing. Our reserved seats were changed- I get these things happen but how many things can go wrong? Turns out, I was sitting in the only seat (apart from the back ones, where you have leg room) where the reclining mechanism was totally missing. Some lucky people in front of me exercised their right to recline. 6 hours later in Plymouth, I was fine but with a very sore back and neck. It is cheap, go into it with a good book, unlimited data and in good health. I also now know that if I ever do Race Across The World, I might use Flixbus, but wouldn’t go with my daughter."

The driver was rude from the momment the bus stopped and was refusing passage to two under 16 girls who had a ticket but it wasn't the same as their ID as their parents had booked the ticket. The driver had obviously had a bad day as she was refusing to move the bus goodness knows why !! It was an hour and a half late to start with and after 40 minutes of the bus drivers tantrums which also resulted in a fellow driver asking her to just drive my daughter and her friends got off and luckily got an uber to Dundee. The bus was still there when they left in their taxi. Shameful display of behaviour from the driver and those poor young girls who were alost left stranded must have at one point been frantic as they had no money if they had been refused the bus hourney. Goodness knows if the bus ever moved but I would suspect there will be a few complaints to the company about this one! And requests for refunds.

And it gets better...... |  | After a day in Paris seeing the sights, ticking of my sisters Paris bucket list, and laughing about this experience so we don't cry. |  | We got back to the bus terminal very early waiting for are late night coach, it appears on the bord but no bus gate. And 5 mins until it arrives it's still there..... But no bus gate number... We asked another flix bus if they knew what was happening, he told us to go figure it out. The bus terminal help center was shut. Very rough terminal, people drinking, no toilets, people are peeing outside on the ground. Loud music, yelling. |  | Over an hour past are coach time it changed to delayed.... There were family's, older people and a couple of little kids left with us waiting for our coach. At 3am despite emails to the company, and via there socials, met with the standard email reply. The rudeness of other flix coach drivers. And the joy of then being stuck in this bus station with literally rats running around the garbage. We finally got an email 3am... To say it's been cancelled... No explanation. To rebook onto another coach or refund.... There was no coaches for 48 hours.... So we had to wait till sunrise taking it in turns to sit on a dirty wall in the worse bus station I have ever been in, for the whole night. We had to pay hundreds of pounds to get home on the euro train. And after speaking via email with flix, they offered to refund the cost of train tickets (minus the coach refund for return travel)...... | That was June.... It's now August. And after taking my bank details and saying numerous times they were or have refunded.... I confirmed with my bank this has never ever been done. |  | AVOID AT ALL COSTS."

Flixbus UK,Seat reservation disaster,2,,2024-08-23T12:04:02.000Z,"Once again seat reservation didn't match what I booked. | Don't like having to ask people to vacate their seats. | Explained to driver that I booked front panorama right, to be told I must sit on the left. Right occupied 👎 | Cardiff has become a nightmare taking far to long due to stop location. | Where it is now, is just too far for perspective passengers, who usually have to bus it in to the city anyways. | Flix need to operate a service to Birmingham, for connecting services to the Midlands and all points north. | National express is the only viable option."

Help team close chats as soon as they are sent to them, without time to even read them... Keep well clear!"

Flixbus UK,"Worst experience, FlixBus not recommended",1,,2024-08-20T06:03:47.000Z,"We had booked tickets for bus on flix bus app to travel to Dubrovnik from split this includes pre booking of seats. But when we reached the bus station, neither there was a flux bus , not we got seats which we reserved, as the bus not from flux bus and seat reservation was a joke. So we wasted our money pre booking seats, also the bus which was allocated was pathetic, the air conditioning was poor and had to experience extreme heat and discomfort inside the bus"

Flixbus UK,A trip with positivity,5,,2024-08-19T18:31:53.000Z,"Travelling from Sheffield meadowhall to London Victoria, Friday 16th August at 08:00 with Driver Shaun. I have great respect for Shaun as he seemed to have made everyone on the coach feel happy. He had a great sense of humour offered chocolates & told everyone that they are special & can achieve anything. This was a great start to my short break. And personally I needed to hear positivity cos things are so glum at the moment. There should be more Shaun’s in this world."
Flixbus UK,Terrible - Would not refund despite saying they would,1,,2024-08-19T18:25:10.000Z,"My son booked a ticket , but due to the app being not clear he booked it for the wrong day. He quickly noticed and as it was impossible to get in touch with the company he booked a second ticket for the correct date. He then cancelled the first ticket and received a voucher for less than half the amount. All this happened within two hours. When he got home he went on the chat, who at first told him that he would get a full refund, then they said they were keeping 50% for 'charges'. They said they would refund the voucher, then they said they wouldn't. My son is about £40 pounds down now and stuck with a voucher he can't use. Customer service were abysmal and unfriendly and the company just plain greedy and uncaring. He is just a student and they have robbed him of his money."

Visiting a friend, in the past I’ve travelled by National Express but now there is only Flixbus and only one bus a day there and back, why not more buses from London to Peterborough? In future I’ve decided I’ll probably just take the train which is pricey, but more options with times to travel and more comfort. Bit of a shame really"
