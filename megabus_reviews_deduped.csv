Megabus,Useless and unhelpful.,1,,2025-03-27T11:14:22.000Z,"My son was booked on the 22.00 M20 from Finchley Road to Glasgow. He was at the bus stop 15 minutes before the bus was due. Not only did the bus not arrive, but when we tried to track the bus, we could not find it as it said that it did not exist. Even when he used his reference number on his ticket, it said that it did not exist. | When he complained to Megabus, not only did they say that the bus ran, but his ticket had been scanned at 22.04. If that had been the case, he would not have had to book to come up the following day on National Express. | They still can not admit they made a mistake. | We will NEVER use Megabus again, but if you want to be ripped off, then by all means use them."
Megabus,I recently had a disappointing…,1,,2025-03-18T03:58:03.000Z,"I recently had a disappointing experience with Megabus that I feel compelled to share. My friend and I were accused of being too young to board our journey, which was not only frustrating but also completely unfounded. We had valid tickets and were well within the age limits. It was embarrassing to be questioned in front of other passengers for something that was not true. |  | To make matters worse, we were not allowed to bring any food on board, which added to our discomfort during the trip. It's disappointing to see a company that should prioritize customer service treating its passengers this way. I expected a much better experience, and I hope that Megabus can improve its policies and staff training in the future."

Megabus,Swelteringly hot,2,,2025-03-09T12:00:33.000Z,"Edit: to give megabus their credit I can tell my feedback has been listened to on the heat. Unfortunately the response on this weeks bus has been for AC to be on full blast making it too cold. Its not difficult to set heating to a reasonable level so I can only assume the crew aren’t happy about the feedback. Still at least I can layer up and cold is better in that way. The crew on this bus (London to Glasgow) are also very nice and professional, compared with other services this makes all the difference. They still need to stop people leaning their seats back but otherwise this trip was better if a little packed. |  | Swelteringly hot, packed in, low legroom and tight luggage racks. No wifi. People allowed to have their devices blaring out on loudspeakers. Uncomfortable seats. Driver was pleasant but thats the only positive."
Megabus,Thieves…,1,,2025-03-05T06:37:18.000Z,"Trying to book a ticket from Aberdeen to Dundee only to see that the price has increased from £11.99 to £15.99, almost 34% increase for booking a month prior ticket. That’s daylight Robbery for a cold bus with most drivers that are disrespectful of people’s time. Sorry, you guys will lose your customers to flix bus!"
Megabus,threatened by another passenger,1,,2025-02-26T15:41:41.000Z,"I have chosen Megabus quite a lot of times for things and they are either really good or really bad (mostly bad) however after my recent experience, i wont be choosing them again. I booked myself on the 10:30 Birmingham to Manchester coach on February 15th and i booked the front row seat. when i got on the coach, it was on time and the driver checked me in and i went to my seat where i saw someone sitting in my reserved seat. i apologised to the person sitting in the seat and asked them to move but then behind the seat a man started calling me names such as D***head for kicking someone out their seat when i paid for it. the worst part was that it wasnt his seat i had taken. I was stood there as they moved but they were travlling with someone else and they gave me the isle seat when i paqid window. As i tried explaining this he kept shouting at me. When i tried telling them that they gave me the wrong seat he kept on shouting at me Infront of everyone. As i was on my own, i decided for my own safety that i should sit down as i was unsure what he would have done. i paid £5 for a seat i didn't even get. When i got to Manchester, i told one of the two drivers and he coundnt care any less. I wont be using them anytime soon and i hope that they sort themselves out as this couldve gotten bad. I have travelled by coach/train for years and this is the first time i felt unsafe when travelling. Megabus for years have been delayed, overpriced and in general low level but this was my final straw"
Megabus,Bus driver’s door wouldn’t close and…,1,,2025-02-24T19:49:49.000Z,"Bus driver’s door wouldn’t close and driver had no clue what to do. We had a plane to catch there was a 50 minute delay , we had to make an on the spot decision and got someone to pick us up and take us to the airport. Megabus refused to refund the ticket, never use them again, terrible customer service and poor quality buses. STAY WELL CLEAR"
Megabus,Reminded me why I stop using the bus.,1,,2025-02-22T11:45:08.000Z,"Traveling by bus for more than two hours is always a negative experience. The type of people this service attracts is worth researching. Despite booking a seat for extra comfort, the person in front of me couldn’t comprehend that reclining his seat that far back would significantly reduce my already limited space in the second row—I had to remind him twice. |  | The person sitting next to me seemed to be digging for gold in his nose while eating a sandwich at the same time. Meanwhile, the two ladies at the back couldn’t figure out how to turn off their flash, so every time they received a notification, we all had to witness it. |  | To make matters worse, people reeking of weed were allowed on board. At this point, where do we draw the line? The creep sitting in the front row couldn’t stop staring, which made the whole journey even more uncomfortable. |  | I can handle rude staff, but the type of creeps these cheap services attract is genuinely unsettling. The only reason I chose this option was because trains to York were delayed, and the bus would have taken the same amount of time to reach London. But, of course, buses are always delayed, so the trip ended up taking an extra hour. |  | Never again, nothing against the service, I just can’t be bothered to teach grown people common sense. The smell alone was unbearable—some people don’t seem to know what water is or what it’s used. |  | Although the driver was very kind to let in people who booked the other way around."

Megabus,Travelling with megabus today on…,1,,2025-02-16T20:32:45.000Z,"Travelling with megabus today on service M19 from Glasgow to Birmingham. | This service is run by McLeans coaches of Airdrie. | This is the third time we have travelled with the same crew, a male and female. Both of these individuals are unbelievably rude and unhelpful to each and every passenger. | Today, passengers were loading their luggage whilst we were trying to locate our bags to leave the service. All the while the male driver stood idly by watching me, a disabled man struggling to locate my bag. After reaching all the way to the back of the hold, he had the audacity to tell that all I had to do was ask for help to which I replied that I shouldn't have needed to ask as it was rather obviously a shambolic system. | If you want to travel with rude unhelpful staff who make no announcements whatsoever as well as not honouring seat reservations then hop aboard. | Personally, I will never travel with megabus ever again"
Megabus,Please bring back this service back to…,5,,2025-02-14T16:02:52.000Z,Please bring back this service back to Bristol. We need Bristol to London. National express is utterly useless please
Megabus,Things can be easily managed if only…,1,,2025-02-10T15:27:17.000Z,Things can be easily managed if only Megabus can use little bit of common sense. Also at least make some effort to depart the buses on time. Regular 30 mins delay without any explanation is unacceptable. Passengers get late for their onward journey due to this.
Megabus,A company that doesn't care about customers,1,,2025-02-05T17:23:52.000Z,"8:30 bus 31st January Aberdeen-Edinburgh Airport. Was supposed to arrive but the operator said it wouldn't due to technical problems. I didn't get on the bus because it just wasn't there! After a while I write to get my money back because of problems beyond my control, they tell me the bus arrived an hour later, that is, at 9:30. |  | I wrote to the mail - enquiries@megabus. | They told me, rudely in the chat and then more loyally by mail, the money will not be returned, since the delay is less than 120 minutes! Think about it! You will not get any guarantees with this company!"
Megabus,Don't get caught out...,2,,2025-02-02T17:29:08.000Z,"Utterly shocked at the more than 100% price differential for pre-booking online. Plenty of space on the bus and should have bought my return (valid for 28 days) on the day with the driver at £10:30 as opposed to the online fee of £22.49! | I appreciate prices may vary slightly and expect to pay more to guarantee a seat, but really, this doesn't feel right. | My advice to others, think carefully before booking online. | Such a shame as driver, comfort and overall journey experience was excellent."
Megabus,I traveled with Megabus on Saturda the…25th of January,5,,2025-01-28T20:04:06.000Z,I traveled with Megabus on Saturday the 25th of January as Glasgow rail service was cancelled due to the weather. I was lucky to get a ticket on the 1.25 service from Glasgow to London. The long journey (9hours) was made so much easier due to the lovely people who were looking after us. Declan was our first contact and he went above and beyond to make sure all his passengers were safe and well informed throughout the journey. Top bloke who definitely deserves a big thank you from all. Andy Fawbert
Megabus,I was treated poorly by the driver…,1,,2025-01-24T02:16:07.000Z,"I was treated poorly by the driver because he didn’t even know the rules of the company he works for. I had the Totum digital card, but he refused to accept it, insisting he could only accept the physical version. Even after I explained that both were the same, he made me pay for another full ticket or threatened to leave me stranded in an unfamiliar city."
Megabus,Saved the day,5,,2025-01-23T12:31:55.000Z,Saved my holiday by having spaces available after my originally planned travel to the airport had been cancelled that very morning
Megabus,very bad experience,1,,2025-01-21T14:40:06.000Z,"very bad experience, as I have used this bus provider for second time and second time my routes were cancelled, I had really important appointment in London, and I had to pay a lot of money to get there otherwise"
Megabus,NEVER AGAIN,1,,2025-01-20T13:44:38.000Z,"Bristol Airport to Bridgwater 15.10 18th January. The bus was cancelled, no explanation, no notification just a note on Twitter or X, nothing to let other passengers know. Left 20 odd people on the stand, no bus until 16.45 and no guarantee it would fit all the people now waiting for the bus"
Megabus,Awful experience on Falcon Megabus…,1,,2025-01-14T01:40:42.000Z,"Awful experience on Falcon Megabus between Plymouth and Bristol Airport. When travelling to the airport, I was sitting on a freezing cold bus for 3 hours. Today I m heading back home in cold again. When I asked the driver if he could turn the heating on he said that he keeps the coach cold on purpose as otherwise he feels sleepy! Appaling. All passengers sit with their coats on. | If I could give this company a zero rating, I would. Used to be much better."

Megabus,Robert and Alik Stewart from Glasgow,5,,2025-01-01T23:59:02.000Z,"I travelled from Manchester with drivers Robert and Alik Stewart and they were two of the kindest people I have met in my life. I was coming home after New Year’s Eve and believe I had alchohol poisoning and could not stop being sick. Both Robert and alik did everything they could to make the journey home easier, they let me stay downstairs where there were no passengers so I was close to the toilet and wasn’t surrounded by other people. They checked in on me all the time, brought me tissues and sanitizer after I was sick and towards the end brought me over a chocolate bar which really cheered me up! It was such a smooth journey and I cannot speak more highly of the two drivers."
Megabus,Like many I don't read the small print,3,,2024-12-30T23:46:36.000Z,"Like many I don't read the small print, impaired vision makes it difficult. I was going on a holiday so had a suitcase and a handluggage case and was told I'm only meant to have 1 case weighing 20kg max. I felt bad even though I was reluctantly aloud to take both. Bus back was awful. Had same situation with the cases although reluctantly let on with them. Toilet was out of action I asked if they'd be stopping anywhere and ther driver cupped her hands and suggested peeing in the street. Not good for IBS suffer. Over 6 hour trip. Just to add Manchester to Newport.. delays hence 6 hours. 1.45pm bus."

Megabus,I recently had a disappointing…,1,,2024-12-25T22:12:18.000Z,"I recently had a disappointing experience with MegaBus. My bus arrived at my destination 2 hours late, which was extremely inconvenient. According to their policy, a refund should be issued if the bus is significantly delayed. However, despite multiple attempts to contact customer service, I have not received my refund or any meaningful assistance. |  | The lack of accountability and poor customer service is frustrating. While I understand that delays can happen, honoring your refund policy is the least you can do to maintain trust with your customers. | I expected better from such a large company. I wouldn’t recommend MegaBus unless you’re willing to risk delays without recourse."
Megabus,Cancelled 2 weeks before my trip,1,,2024-12-24T18:59:33.000Z,Cancelled 2 weeks before my trip. | Had to rearrange as had lots of things booked. Nightmare! | Avoid use National Express!

Megabus,Terrible Experience - Missed Bus and Poor Communication,1,,2024-12-23T18:22:34.000Z,"I booked a bus ticket with Megabus to travel to Birmingham on 20 December at 15:30. I arrived at the bus stop at 15:20 and waited until 16:10, but the bus never came. When I called the hotline, your staff informed me that a M11 bus to Glasgow had arrived at 15:40, and I was apparently supposed to take that bus. |  | This info was never mentioned in the confirmation email or invoice, and I didn’t see any Megabus arriving at the stop during that time. The tracking website was useless as it didn’t recognize my order or reservation number. |  | I was supposed to reach Birmingham in 3 hours, but due to this confusion, I had to purchase another ticket from a different company and ended up taking 8 hours to reach my destination. Another customer waiting at the stop with me had the same issue. |  | This experience was incredibly frustrating, and the lack of clear communication is unacceptable. I will think twice before booking with Megabus again."
Megabus,Don’t bother using Megabus they’re unreliable and don’t bother stopping if they’re late even if you have booked,1,,2024-12-22T11:17:37.000Z,"I | I was waiting at the bus stop wearing a fluorescent lit band and the bus went straight past me! |  | booked a ticket for the 9M8 Sunday morning 7:39 am M8 bus from Gleneagles to Perth. | I was alone, female standing by a major road that wasn’t busy at a bus stop and it’s -2 C t he didn’t bother to stop ! | Absolutely atrocious"

Megabus,Vandictive Supervisor at Manchester Shudehill continous gross misconduct,1,,2024-12-22T09:20:38.000Z,"Because of the continous conduct of one main supervisor at  Manchester Shudehill and megasbus lack of accountability, the service does not deserve even one star ratng . |  | It all began about a year ago  when I had seen a price which was on the site . I came into the shop and the staff ( a caucasion , a slim bald head guy in his late 60s who often is seen around stand G when the coaches arrive). He was about to process my ticket. I asked if he could secure the booking whilst I get some money from the cashpoint( which was just a sec away) . He said he would but  did not. I have been a regular customer and he always served me. |  |  When I returned he informed me the price had increased by an extra £10. Not happy with this .. I double checked online and it was still the same price it was originally. |  | I came back into the shop and spoke to someone else who checked  to see it was the same price as originally stated.. I sent an email to the customer service  department voicing my dissatisfaction of the service I had recieved at the time . |  | The  second encounter was  a few months back when I had arrived early and asked the driver if he has spare seats available , to which he confirmed he did . The supervisor whispered to the him and I was the told that no seats were available  . The supervisors colleague  was also there and  enabled his actions. |  | I have been travelling with Megabus service for over 20 years and within the last 5 years my encounter with the supervisor  has been great,  until last year in which his attitude towards me changed . Which i contribute to the first complaint made where he waa deliberately been vandictive. |  | A few weeks back  12.40pm . I saw the name on the screen of the advisor as  Wayne Davies ( I am not sure it was his name  or he was just using someone elses account ) |  | I  arrived to purchased a ticket for the Xmas period and checked  prior to arrival  .I saw the  dates and prices  shown as available . I called in and the same supervisor said there was no service running as the company is going out of business. |  | Because of my encounter with him prior , I was skeptic of what he had advised me ,so  I called customer services and spoke with a lovely woman by the name of Lucy, who advised a service from Glasgow to London is running , so I will be able to purchase tickets. |  | I came back into the shop and was greeted by him who  became aggressive and arrogant.  His manager was able to  pull up the information( despite not intervening and questioning why he had provided me with  incorrect information at the time I came to purchase the ticket ) and I was able to purchase the tickets. |  | I overheard him say to his manager that he ,"" could not be bothered "". I'm assuming his reference was in regards to the misinformation and the lack of care he demonstrated throughout. He seems to have a huge chip on his shoulder which possibly also comes from the fact someone much younger, more professional than his sorry self is about to take his spot whiles he sits home looking at 4 walls whilst dipping  biscuits in his cold tea |  | He had mentioned  prior that he was due to retire |  | I am absolutely discussed at the fact that he continues to get away with such blatant disregard and audacity. No doubt it is people such as him that contributed to the state of the service . |  | I have always loved travelling with Megabus and it is people such as him that puts a damper and tarnishes the brands name. The fact that he was arrogant and claimed he no longer cared because he is approaching retirement is a disgrace and I wondering why he had not retired earlier as his onl contribution has been trying to put the company into disrepute- which it so appears. |  | I was on the call with a nice customer service advisor named  Lucy throughout and she was prevy to what had transpire. |  | I again called today and spoke to an arrogant unprofessional customer service advisor who refused to provide his surname,  other than to give his name as Aaron. He was completed unsympathetic to the response of my complaint.  He refused to confirm whether he will deal with the complaint competently.  I  was looking to change my time at no additipnal price given all these issues I had been experiencing ,a goodwill gesture should have been given,  . He kept requesting my reference but refused to confirm whether he would . He refused to pass me through  to management or another staff. |  | Throughout the call, his tone and handling of it made me lose trust in him. Just like the supervisor at Shudehill,  I felt he will do something vandictive and cancel my booking. |  | I can understand why this service has gone under . It is a sorry state in fhe world when staff such as these are allowed to operate in a manner which they do and constantly get away with it |  | CS depart refused to take accountability other than to send patronising templated emails like they do on here."
Megabus,No refreshment break,4,,2024-12-18T14:04:13.000Z,"I have been travelling with Megabus between Manchester and London for the last 3 years to visit my son. I have found Megabus to be reliable, comfortable and the staff polite and friendly. Sadly the termination of your short service meant we had to book the cross border service and our coach didn't leave Manchester until 4.25 so our arrival in London was around 9.30 pm and our onward journey resulted in our arrival at our son at 11pm. This was OK with us both travelling but I often travel alone and as I am over 70 I don't feel comfortable travelling so late at night. I had no idea there was no stop for refreshment and a chance to move around outside so we only brought a small bottle of water. 5 hours is a long time without a break. I couldn't fault the drivers and the coach was comfortable but it is regrettable that daytime services are no longer available."
Megabus,Good,4,,2024-12-17T22:48:35.000Z,It was good journey
Megabus,terrible,1,,2024-12-17T21:38:57.000Z,"terrible, I drove 3 times, and all 3 times I was late for more than an hour. drove even longer than indicated in the route by 30-50 minutes. I will not use it!!!!!"
Megabus,Your cancellation disrupted my plans,1,,2024-12-17T19:37:02.000Z,"You canceled loads of your December services. This creates severe disruption for all the people who have booked. You could (but didn't) have the decency to put us onto a competitor's bus, like a self-respecting airline might. You've lost a lot of trust..."
Megabus,Ride was fine but coach arrived an hour late.,3,,2024-12-17T19:03:02.000Z,The actual coach ride was ok. I managed to book a front seat so it was quite comfortable and didn’t take much longer than it was supposed to. The coach did however arrive an hour later than planned which is why I’ve only given 3 stars. Them saying to arrive 15 minutes early and then coming an hour late meant I was waiting in the cold for a long time.
Megabus,Edinburgh to Leeds,3,,2024-12-17T18:59:40.000Z,"13/12/24 - Trip to Leeds journey down was great apart from being 50 mins late, the drivers were great and informative of where we were and how long we would be etc. | 15/12/24 - The return journey not so great! Bus was 50 mins late getting into Leeds, The drivers from Leeds to Newcastle were great again, every informative. But the driver from Newcastle to Edinburgh was speeding in very high winds and bad weather and swerving all over the road. Also the toilet from Durham was obviously full and smelling not very nice for the 3 hrs we were left on the bus, maybe every 3 hrs or so the toilets needs to be emptied and cleaned."

Megabus,I enjoyed the city link,3,,2024-12-17T18:26:46.000Z,"I enjoyed the city link. However, the male driver was harsh and unfriendly to me. First, I requested to go to the toilet before leaving Manchester, but you spoke to me rudely. Secondly, we had a long stopover on our way; though I saw other vehicles waiting, there was no announcement. Thirdly, when we arrived at the first bus stop in London, I asked the driver if I could find my way to West Hendon. He told me he didn't know, and when I decided to follow him to Victoria Station, he sounded rude and unfriendly again."
Megabus,keep your voice low.,1,,2024-12-16T21:15:27.000Z,i booked seats with table but there wasn’t any tables.

Megabus,Very late,3,,2024-12-15T15:10:22.000Z,"I used to love Megabus but my last three trips home from Manchester to Cardiff have been really late. Ended up missing my next bus home and to get Uber at £25-30 a time. Also the driver to Cardiff on November 26th had to keep slamming his brakes on. One lady behind me actually commented about him seeming drunk, it was a very jerky ride which put my back out for two days after due to permanent tissue damage. I'm booked again for December 29th but considering changing company 😔"

Megabus,Do not use this service,1,,2024-12-13T19:33:40.000Z,"Do not use this service. They get to your destination late. The driver also decided to take a 10 minute break along the way. Pathetic, not trustworthy, will never use them again."
Megabus,Megabus have cancelled all there…,1,,2024-12-12T18:41:52.000Z,Megabus have cancelled all there journeys in England for example the Newcastle to Southampton service! When I say I am extremely angry this does not even cut it! I depended on megabus for all my journeys from university and back and they were the BEST company with affordable prices and now that they’ve cancelled these services due to the less customer demand apparently my only option is the trains which are over £100 per return! I could rarely get a seat on my megabus service so how is this not a popular demand! It goes from Southampton all the way to Newcastle and the buses were always sold out!

The bus was spotless and the staff cheery and helpful. The seats where the problem. They were far too close to the one in front. There was no trays that could be accessed from seat in front. My legs were crushed as the leg room was totally unacceptable. This journey takes 4hrs and was the most uncomfortable journey I have had. Also the £3 seat reservation was not refundable. Unless they can ensure the type of coach selected by the company I will return to using the railway service it may cost more but at least it's a comfortable journey. The seats on the coach did not have a tray usually fitted to the rear of the seat in front. Whole journey was very uncomfortable.

Megabus,Terrible Experience with Megabus,1,,2024-12-03T08:20:22.000Z,"Terrible Experience with Megabus – Will Never Use Again! |  | I’m extremely disappointed with Megabus and will never use their services again. I took my sister to the bus stop 15 minutes before the scheduled departure time, excited for her first holiday. However, she ended up waiting in cold and wet weather for over 1.5 hours without any clarity or shelter. This delay not only put her travel plans at serious risk but also caused unnecessary stress and worry during what should have been a positive experience. |  | After waiting 1.5 hours with no updates from Megabus, I contacted their out-of-hours service and was informed that the bus was delayed by three hours. At no point were we—or any of the other passengers waiting—notified of this. Instead, Megabus claimed they had posted the delay on Twitter. Neither my sister nor I use Twitter, and relying on a social media platform for such critical information is impractical and insufficient. |  | When I questioned why updates weren’t sent via email or text, I was told it would be considered ""spam."" It’s baffling how essential updates about booked travel arrangements could be deemed spam when they are crucial for passengers. I was further informed that Megabus does not have a system in place for notifying customers via email or text. |  | To ensure my sister didn’t miss her flight, I had no choice but to drive her to Manchester Airport myself—from Cardiff—at the last minute. This resulted in significant costs and inconvenience: |  | £60 in petrol expenses |  | £5 airport drop-off fee |  | Over 7 hours of travel time during hazardous weather conditions (Storm Bert), in the middle of the night (10:30 PM–5:30 AM), which posed serious safety risks. |  | This entire ordeal was completely avoidable if Megabus had implemented an effective and inclusive notification system. Instead, we were left stressed, inconvenienced, and significantly out of pocket. |  | I cannot recommend Megabus to anyone after this experience. Their lack of communication, disregard for passenger safety, and poor customer service have left me deeply disappointed. If you value reliability and stress-free travel, I strongly advise avoiding Megabus. |  | **EDIT** REPLY TO MEGABUS | We have already emailed your team regarding this incident and received a very unsatisfactory response. While you agreed to refund the cost of the bus tickets (excluding the £2 booking fee), you refused to take any responsibility for the lack of communication with customers and refused to reimburse the additional expenses caused by your delay, citing your terms and conditions as justification. |  | Given this experience, we will not be using your services again."
Megabus,"Aberdeen to Edinburgh in 12+ hrs, avoid megabus…",1,,2024-11-29T13:08:13.000Z,"Aberdeen to Edinburgh in 12+ hrs with megabus. Cycling take only 12 hrs. Worst experience ever and poorly managed by megabus staff, never again. | Coach departed Aberdeen at 16:30, the A90 was closed following collision near Fordoun and traffic was diverted onto the A92. After 4.5 hours the coach stopped at Arbroath to comply with the rule. You cannot drive for longer than 4.5 hours without taking a break of at least 45 minutes. Up to this point everything is perfectly understandable. After the 45mins break, the driver informed us that he had been driving since 6:30 and that he could not take it anymore. So, we had to wait for the next bus to take us from Arbroath to Dundee. Once we arrived in Dundee, we were left in limbo with no further information. The bus station was closed, and other drivers told us they couldn't do anything as it wasn't their problem. One of the passengers insisted, and a driver told us that we needed to wait at least half an hour for another bus to arrive that will take us to Halbeath Bus Park & Ride at located to the east of Dunfermline. We arrived at Halbeath Bus Park & Ride at midnight and then another coach took us to the Edinburgh Airport arriving at the hotel at 23:50 am."

When I asked the driver why I was being charged this he was unable to answer the question and was very confrontational. This may seem a little petty but as a full time volunteer, every penny is a big deal to me.

However, the bus departed without me, leaving me stranded. | When I contacted Mega Bus customer care, I was shocked by their response. They claimed that they were not responsible for me after I had left the bus, and suggested that I book another ticket. |  | ""I find this response unacceptable, especially since I had informed the conductor of my intention to step out.

The poor driver was told to do the run or cancel as another driver hadn't turned into do the shift.(Not the bus drivers fault, it's the management at fault.) We didn't get our reserved seats although we got near to them. The driver was replaced at Birmingham by another Driver. By the time we got to Bristol we was around 2 hours late. Plus the return Journey a few days later although the time was fine we got told just to get on and sit anywhere again we didn't get the reserved seats. Apparently it wasn't an actual Megabus so the driver obviously wasn't bothered. But the buses being late has been happening for at least 2 or 3 years as both myself and my daughter make trips to Bristol and back over the years and everyone more or less has been getting into our destination approx 2 hours late. This should have been fixed by getting extra buses on to get passengers to where they need to be more on time."

Megabus,Megabus Delay Ruined My Trip and Caused Significant Financial Losses,1,,2024-11-09T06:52:30.000Z,"Unreliable Service Led to Major Financial and Personal Losses"" |  | I am extremely disappointed with Megabus due to an experience that caused a cascade of losses totalling around £1,500 in one day. Our journey was delayed from the outset, with the bus arriving 20 minutes late at the station and departing at 9:25 pm instead of the scheduled 9 pm. This initial delay set off a chain reaction, leading us to miss our flight from London. |  | We had rented a car at our destination, which we missed due to this delay, costing us additional money. We purchased another plane ticket for the same day, but that flight was subsequently cancelled, forcing us to purchase a ticket for the following evening to a neighbouring country. This led to a 42-hour stay at the airport, entirely at our own expense. |  | Due to these delays, we missed urgent appointments at our original destination and could not extend our work leave, putting our jobs at risk. When I reached out to Megabus management, I was informed that the bus arrived in Bristol at 1:57 am, which was false; it actually arrived at 2:04 am, causing us to miss our 2 am connection to London. Because of those lost four minutes (even if the bus was delayed with 41 minutes, four minutes would have been enough to not lose all the connections), we missed every subsequent connection and, ultimately, our flight. |  | Additionally, many other passengers faced similar issues that day, indicating a broader reliability issue. I strongly urge anyone considering Megabus for its affordability to think twice. It is worth paying a little more for a reliable service that ensures you reach your destination on time. Punctuality is evidently not a priority for Megabus, and this lack of reliability is costly for passengers. |  | --- |  | This feedback is formal and focuses on the significant financial and personal consequences, with a warning for other potential customers."
Megabus,TRAVELERS BEWARE,1,,2024-11-08T21:26:52.000Z,Absolutley disgusting treatment of people.

The another thing like washroom is made at a very weird place in the bus and it's very difficult and almost next to impossible in order to use the washroom when the bus is moving as there's very less space after going in. Even if I ignore the washroom then timing was very important for me as it took almost 8 hours from London Victoria to Liverpool when there are other services which completes the same journey in 6 hrs

According to the both drivers they were not aware of the function and usage of the lift within the bus. | After a long and exhausting plane journey, It came as a severe shock and disappointment the discomfort my disabled daughter and myself endured. | I really would appreciate an explanation for this incident | As it really affected me mentally and physically , how did you expect me to carry a child in my lap all the way from Manchester airport to Cardiff? | On top of all this stress our luggage got stolen. One suitcase with full of brand-new shopping and 1 backpack. Megabus is not helpful at all in regards to sorting out this matter as well. Very disappointed.

Megabus,Appalling customer service and seat reservation rip off!,1,,2024-10-31T18:02:36.000Z,"*Seat reservation rip off* | Not talking a lot of money but you are misleading your customers.At time of booking you notify coach layouts may differ but you know what you are doing… |  | Reservation Number - 28/10/24 | 37-4940-281024-M84-1515-MIA-PRM-68 |  | On Monday 28th October I didn’t have a great experience with Megabus. My trip was scheduled from Manchester Airport Bus Station at 15:15pm to Portsmouth arriving at 21:35pm. I’m new to relying on this type of travel after some health concerns and currently awaiting radiotherapy starting in November. |  | I got to the Airport bus station nice and early, 2pm. During my wait the only Megabus I saw was mine eventually arriving just before 4pm (45 minutes late) these things happen which is fine. I booked an advance lower deck seat for obvious reasons. |  | Whilst waiting for my pickup I was on hold for 25 minutes to check with customer service to see if the service was still running due to the lack of information? Nobody answered my call. There are no staff whatsoever at the station “which you say there is should you need them” The information screens were also all ‘switched off’ so customers are stranded. |  | When the coach finally arrived, the driver clearly in a rush shouted to me ‘where are you going mate?’ to which I replied Portsmouth. He asked me to wait near the door down at the back of the bus. Though there first and waiting where I was told, I was seen to last. Other people that had been sent down my way just before were seen to and boarded the bus first. |  | When I showed my ticket, the driver said you are upstairs mate. I pointed out that I’d booked the table seat downstairs but he said there wasn’t one. |  | As I boarded I saw that there was a table seat and the configuration of the seats was as I’d booked. I found seat 68 upstairs and was next to the stairs, not great for me as I didn’t want to climb stairs after recently having brain surgery. |  | During the trip at one of the stops I went downstairs and checked that the table seat I booked was a different number but with the same layout. |  | So my question is why are you charging people to reserve and pay for a seat when they end up in one of the seats they could have sat in without paying a reservation fee for??? |  | During the trip I also received an email to state the company was scaling back operations due to low customer demand which was poor timing! I wonder why? I had the feeling that your customers are not important to you at numerous times on this trip. The low demand follows this type of treatment over a substantial period of time of your customers. |  | Later on in the trip at the Oxford stop I asked the driver roughly how long did he think we were running behind schedule as I had a connecting ferry to make. He half lowered down the window and shouted, “Not my fault mate, Megabus don’t set realistic times for us to make and that’s why there’s 2 drivers on here so we can get going and make up time” |  | The driving on these coaches is erratic at best and having been a Police driver I would confidently say it’s only a matter of time until one is involved in an accident. |  | While I’m at it, the seat I ended up on had no charging point for me to use and the toilet had no running water out of the tap, pretty rough really. |  | I’d recommend a note on your booking system to notify people “at no stop will we stop long enough for you to get a drink/food/refreshments of any kind - so politely remind people to take enough with them for the journey. I’m also diabetic, but when you think you can grab something along the way but later find out you can’t, this is a problem. |  | I don’t expect the world, but I certainly appreciate small efforts by a company to look after a customer paying to use their service. |  | Result = I won’t be using or recommending Megabus again in my lifetime. You have already lost 1 customer as a friend of mine will not book with you due to this for a November trip to Southampton from Manchester. |  | I wonder if you will realise what you are doing and become a market leading business in your field, or will you simply have to keep scaling back until you go bust??? |  | Never again…"

This delay forced me and my children to wait in the queue at the bus station for an extended period. We have tarvelled from Scotland to London on 27th october again the bus arrived 30 minutes late, with no updates provided about the delay. Despite paying extra to reserve specific seats, they were taken by others who boarded before us, forcing us to sit elsewhere. Additionally, the bus seats were extremely dirty and had a strong, unpleasant odor."

Megabus,Megabus are finishing,1,,2024-10-28T11:50:21.000Z,"Megabus are finishing the driver told me I just got picked up at Leeds to go to Bristol and then dropped off with everyone on the bus at Huddersfield and told in half an hour another bus will come and pick you up to finish your journey as the driver had gone over his legal driving time. My journey the other way had no stops???? They've lost the plot obviously as they are packing in they couldn't give a toss for passengers now?? I'm still at Huddersfield a woman on her own hoping I do get home eventually the driver is here having his lunch happily but there's no bus so he took it off site really and left us in the bus station whilst he had his break I phoned Megabus they have no idea what's going on and neither do Huddersfield station??? What a bloody mess??? Thank heavens they are packing in Id say after this Is Iwouldn't get another bus no matter who owns them, it's gone to the dogs. The drivers are running it. Well a girl on my coach was just recalling her journey today with Flixbus she was in tears Metro staff were a nightmare to her told her to shut up at the Manchester station. I have to say station staff at Huddersfield are lovely. She had been dropped here there and everywhere after no show buses her journey to Bristol started at 5am and she's not there yet. Definitely don't get a Flix bus!! What's happening to coaches? I thought trains were bad public transport is awful. Think I might buy another car screw the environment lol 😁 I sold mine to help it. Thank you for your reply but this helps me how? I think you should partially refund my journey for the stress. When we were dropped at Huddersfield we were told a bus would be back for us in 30 mins two hours late I was getting back to Bristol at 9pm not 7pm it cost me a Downend taxi at £25 as it was dark and the bus wasn't for another hour. So I think you should refund at least that? Your apology after the fact doesn't help me? I'm diabetic so another two hours is a nightmare for me when I'm not expecting to get off at all. No one bothered to explain that 30 mins turned into two hours? I phoned Megabus HQ you had no idea what had happened?So it was your drivers decision"
Megabus,Wet luggage was not what I booked,3,,2024-10-25T20:43:26.000Z,"Bus journey went without a hitch but when I got to London my suitcase was wet through. The driver told me that it was because it was raining on the motorway but I knew that couldn’t be true. I made a complaint but did not get a satisfactory response (just that it would be looked into but I couldn’t be told the outcome?) Also no recompense for my distress or inconvenience, even though my clothes were wet in my soft-bodied case and I had to wash them while away."
Megabus,Very disappointed,1,,2024-10-24T23:41:05.000Z,"Very disappointed. We dropped our 17 year old daughter off in Leeds to catch the 8.40am bus to London, the instructions said the bus left from stand 1. She could not find stand 1, it was nowhere near stands 2 and 3, which she did find. No signs to say that stand 1 was located in a completely different part of the bus station. No staff around to ask. She missed her bus. When I phoned, they were very unhelpful, said it was her responsibility to get to the bus on time and took no responsibility for the lack of support and guidance for customers. Very poor, will not use again!"

Megabus,Travel in a refrigerator.,2,,2024-10-23T09:53:53.000Z,"Travelling is getting expensive so I thought I'd try megabus. A 8 hour journey from Oxford I was expecting it tough going. First 4 hours were fine , but once it got dark the driver decided to turn on the air conditioning at full blast. By the time I arrived at my destination I was frozen. Now I got a cold. What was always going to be a tough journey ended up being absolutely miserable . No Internet on board and no soap in the toilet as I expected really so made my own arrangements. To be fair the toilet was surprisingly clean. I can't understand what sort of perverse pleasure they take in turning on air con on a cold autumn day ?"

These things happen. | What I was unhappy about was that I reserved seats but it seemed to be a free for all there werent any reserved seats. So why advertise this? I paid for them. | Also felt that the Euro coaches beimg used as a megabus the seats arent as comfortable. Quite narrow, we had no charging points on the bus going to London. | The bus coming from London to Newport the driver was very pleasant and happy, it was nice to see a happy bubbly driver. I didnt get his name but he was driving the 12 noon run to Swansea Sunday 20th October 2024. The coach however was in disrepair, a crack on the front windscreen and a loose seat that needed looking at. Again narrow seats. We were fortunate to sit at the front and the seats here felt a little more roomy. | It was a long journey back due to traffic and a diversion on the M4 due to lane closures at junction 17-18. Again,this couldnt be helped. Just saying this so people are aware that the pick up and drop off times are a guide."

Upon walking to the driver to enquire his response was “dot even start with me about the changes, I didn’t make them” the friver the proceeded to refuse yo lift my bags and said the “looked heavy and he doesn’t want to hurt his back” he looked like he was in his late forties and stood there while I, a woman in her late twenties put my bag in the coach. Maybe because I am black so I am strong, I don’t know. The next driver at Birmingham did assist me put them in the coach though, no complaints, I was carrying two medium sized luggage. I felt very bad being the only passenger to loaf my bags while the driver watched me and he was having a smoke. Overall bad experience."

Although the service itself was longer than say, National Express, it was still supposed to arrive in Sunderland at 15:35. It is now 15:57 and I am an hour away from Sunderland pretty much, making taking this longer and slightly more expensive journey redundant.

There is clear signage that the Megabus stop is number 6, which is where I waited. No bus arrived at stop number 6 while I was there. I subsequently discovered that the bus actually leaves from stop numbers 1 or 2. I was in a rush to get to Heathrow, so I had to buy a ticket from a different bus company because the next Megabus was only due an hour later. I wrote to Megabus who did not address the issue other than to state ""we do not give refunds"". I did submit photographs of the signage but Megabus did not respond to these. So please be aware if you are considering using Megabus from Gatwick South Terminal as I would not like potential customers to end up in the same position as me."

I emailed megabus in hopes of getting some compensation for the money spent on a train because of their own error, who ever I spoke to over email was incredibly rude and didn’t even try to understand the issue and just claimed I wasn’t going to be compensated as the coach tracker is a “complimentary service” and the bus wasn’t actually late.

I spoke with the drivers as they pulled up each telling me they where not going to Manchester. |  | When I called the customer support line I got no helpful information. In the end I had to carpool in an Uber with 3 other passengers I met at the bus stop. |  | Customer service was bad on the phone but via email was even worse as I requested a refund they refused claiming the coach had been run by a third party (this was not detailed to me in any email correspondence) and had departed on time. |  | Company tried to push blame onto me as the customer claiming it was my fault they didn't make things clear |  | Absolutely atrocious business practice DO NOT USE |  | (Edit) As can be seen by response business in no way shape or form has any intention of refunding despite the issue being their own. They did not clarify the fact prior to travel that it would be a third party (mentioning it ""could"" be on your website isn't enough)"

Also paid extra for a table to ensure leg room which was subject to availability (understandable) but was annoying that it wasn’t on the bus, overall the first set of drivers was so welcoming and kind and they was the only good experience we had on our journey"

There was no information about the bus delay. We tried to contact the operator, unfortunately without success. | 3. After several escalations, we were informed that they would not refund our money. | To sum up, Megabus takes money and does not fulfill its obligations. What's more, they do not feel obliged to make compensation. Unbelievable."

Other people with the 17,35 ticket were taken. but I was left alone.The driver was very loud and insisted that another m82 was 5 mins behind. The following bus bypassed B'ham according to the tracking app. I waited a further hour in the cold, and when I asked a later driver what could be done, he very rudely said it was my fault i'd missed it, and tough luck. This after 2 hours in the cold. I had to make alternative arrangements. I held my cool against the awful rudeness of the drivers , but was terribly upset at my treatment. I am over 70 years old. and became very chilled. Instead of arriving in Newport at 8pm, I didn't get back until 12.50am, and had had to pay again for another journey.

After our stop at the services (much welcomed fresh air!) the driver kindly turned off the heat, this is something that definitely needs to be fixed. | The majority of the journey was plain sailing. | Also, sat behind us other passengers were eating very smelly food, making lots of noise in the process, not what you need at midnight, especially when trying to sleep!"

When we stopped at a station for the drivers to swap the old driver knew about this fault as he was driving with it and the first driver even broke down at main lights and still continued to go ahead with the journey, then when he swapped driver he then told the driver about the fault and nothing was done about it, so when it broken down the second time at yet another main lights I had to then get off with other passengers to arrange another transport idea."

I recently traveled with Megabus from Cardiff University to Middlesbrough on Tuesday, October 1, 2024, at 05:35 AM (Reservation number: 23-9632-011024-M82-0535-CDU-MID-5). Overall, I found the service to be pleasant compared to other bus services. However, I would like to offer a suggestion for improvement based on my personal experience. |  | During my journey, the ticket did not include any information about a transfer at Manchester. It was only when the driver informed me that I needed to change buses there that I became aware of it. Upon arrival in Manchester, I was told to wait for another bus to continue my journey. This caused some unnecessary stress as I did not have any information about the next bus. After waiting for a few minutes, the driver then announced that the same bus would continue to Middlesbrough, and I was relieved to reach my destination on time. |  | To help improve the experience for future passengers, I would suggest that Megabus clearly provide details of any bus changes on the ticket, including the location and specifics of the transfer. This would avoid confusion and ensure a smoother journey for everyone. |  | Thank you for your attention to this matter, and for continuing to offer a reliable service. I appreciate your consideration of this feedback. |  | Best regards, | MD. Nasim Khan"

Namely the seat reservations were not honoured and seating was random on arrival. Then the return coach was 50mins late. Also coach times in general are later than they used to be. The drivers were great. None of this is on them. Feeling unsure if I would use Megabus again due to the recent changes.
Megabus,The coach delayed to arrive Birmingham…,1,,2024-10-09T23:28:49.000Z,The coach delayed to arrive Birmingham with no notice. | The coach was not track able | On top that I arrived by 00:31 and I couldn’t get a bus to my home
Megabus,Good value fir money,4,,2024-10-09T20:08:50.000Z,The bus was fairly comfortable. A little grubby. It was late leaving Newcastle so consequently continued to get later as the journey continued.

Megabus,Service between Plymouth and Bristol…,1,,2024-10-09T10:14:54.000Z,"Service between Plymouth and Bristol airport. Air conditioning not working, USB charging ports not working, bus interior not cleaned. On the positive side the drivers made apologies for these shortcomings and were very friendly and helpful. In a nutshell, great staff but rubbish buses. Finally I would have complained to Megabus directly but link from their website takes me to the bususers website that tells me I can only make a complaint to them if I have made a complaint in the first instance to the bus company. | Just read the reply below, how does this relate to any of my comments? “Our aim is to make bus travel simple”."
Megabus,No WiFi,1,,2024-10-09T07:35:08.000Z,"No WiFi, mobile chargers not working, toilet door constantly opening by itself and banging. Your posters all say that WiFi is available on the coach and one of your staff informed me that it would definitely 100% be available once I was on the coach"
Megabus,I had horrible experience with the FlixBus.,5,,2024-10-08T18:22:05.000Z,"I had horrible experience with the Flix Bus, so I can compare. Megabus was late no more than 5 minutes, drivers was friendly and helpful. Next trip will definitely go with Megabus."
Megabus,Gets you to A to B but rather uncomfortable,2,,2024-10-08T18:11:18.000Z,"Gets you to A to B, majority of the drivers are nice. Some take their time when exchanging drivers, having a mothers meeting when they are already late! | Just a very uncomfortable journey, charger ports do not work with all of the coaches I used. Air-con is not on, and Megabus journeys are way too long as it is with all the stops in each City, especially with added traffic (not company fault of course). I guess this is the cheap option we pay for."

Megabus,Overnight to the north,5,,2024-10-08T13:52:58.000Z,"The buses were clean, tidy and comfortable. The drivers were very professional and firm when they needed to be. I was near enough the front to hear conversations, whilst I was awake, and they were always professional in nature. All in all, I’m very satisfied. Thank you"
Megabus,Brilliant,5,,2024-10-08T09:57:13.000Z,Very pleased with the drive up to Aberdeen both drivers very helpful helped me with my luggage and took care with my 3 wheeled stroller no damage to them | Drive back was just the same going home
Megabus,No issues great route,5,,2024-10-07T23:38:13.000Z,"No issues. Bus on time as usual , love this bus route as you can have a night out in Leeds and be back in Newcastle by 4am"

Megabus,Appalling Service,1,,2024-10-07T21:57:48.000Z,7/10/24 4pm bus from London Victoria to Bristol. you advised you couldn’t drop off at UWE and we would be taken to UWE separately after getting off at Bond Street. When we got to Bond Street the driver had no idea what was happening and made no effort to find out for us. He saw a bus across the street and said ‘he will probably take you when he’s finished his break. This turned out to be the 8pm bus to London and we were dropped off at 6.30. The bus driver that dropped us off didn’t seem to care what was going to happen to us. Appalling service from Megabus.
Megabus,Great experience,5,,2024-10-07T21:32:25.000Z,Nice bus. I liked the seats. Very comfy. Staff friendly. My experience was positive in spite of the 20 minutes delay.

Megabus,Comfortable journey,5,,2024-10-07T19:38:04.000Z,"Comfortable journey, nice and clean seats. Only drawback is no numbers on seats so I wasn’t sure which seat was mine on both my journeys I’ve made on mega bus and as you pay for these seats they should be numbered really. All in all a pleasant experience and my bus was only running half an hour late so not too bad, unless you need to be on time for another connection may be but I guess you can’t help traffic delays"
Megabus,Fantastic service,5,,2024-10-07T16:14:03.000Z,"Fantastic service, friendly and helpful drivers throughout journey both ways, London return at Exeter via Bristol Buses were comfortable, announcements clear and transit info helpful Glad you are the best as I’m coming back to England in five weeks and looking forward to another trip!

Then there is the booking fee on top which is a recent addition. Not good value anymore, poor service and more expensive than national express,who offer a much better service."

Megabus,Wow! Megabus has improved,5,,2024-10-07T13:36:49.000Z,"I travelled on an overnight coach from Bristol to Glasgow for work. I have chronic inflammatory health conditions, so was concerned about the long journey. I needn't have worried. The seats on my coach had lots of leg-room, reclined to a great sleeping position, and the coach was clean and well-maintained. I used to travel by Megabus every month, but felt the timetables were unreliable and condition of coaches not great. What an improvement!"

Megabus,My first time with Megabus,5,,2024-10-07T13:28:28.000Z,"I’m a driver and I drive everywhere, but I have Driven many miles this year and always being the only driver I thought would give Megabus a go I was a bit hesitant of the journey being 5 and a half hours but comparing it to driving I’m so glad I did, it was relaxing comfortable a lot cheaper than the train, the drivers were very informative at every stop and I could tell my friend who was picking me up exactly where I was for her to be able to be at my final destination to collect me. I will definitely use Megabus again."
Megabus,Lovely staffs,4,,2024-10-07T13:07:52.000Z,D drivers and staffs are so considerate and supportive. | D fares are cheap compared to others | However I'd love for u to improve on ur punctuality. The delay is sickening!

Megabus,improve the accuracy of seat maps,1,,2024-10-07T12:11:56.000Z,"I recently booked a journey from London to Edinburgh with MegaBus and selected a specific seat based on the website’s seating map. I chose what was marked as a stair-top seat on the right-hand side of the upper deck (seats 11 & 12), and I paid extra for that choice. |  | However, when I boarded the bus, I discovered that the actual stair-top seats were located on the left-hand side (seats 9 & 10), while seats 11 & 12 were in the fourth row, which is not what I had expected. This discrepancy between the seat layout on the website and the actual seating arrangement on the bus left me disappointed, as I had selected the seat for a particular reason. |  | Overall, while the journey itself was fine, the seat allocation issue affected my experience.."
Megabus,We booked seats 1&2 as one of our party…,3,,2024-10-07T12:08:35.000Z,We booked seats 1&2 as one of our party suffers with travel sickness. On the return journey we was not allowed to sit in the front 2 rows. Was just told on this bus your not allowed to sit there with no explanation as to why. Even when our tickets said seats 1 & 2 she was blunt and said 3rd row back and was abrupt in the way she said it. No one sat in these seats apart from the drivers hangbag. We can only think she didnt want anyone to sit there as she was taking call on her mobile and also driving at times with one hand. Not very good when you already have a anxious person in your party. Let megabus down big time with this kind of driving.
Megabus,Megabus cancelled the bus,1,,2024-10-07T12:08:02.000Z,"Megabus cancelled the bus we had booked. Had to go on National Express instead, and the timings didn't work as well, plus we lost money because we could not use a return ticket."

I am confused and need megabus to clarify this for me, did you expect me to wait and lose any change to get to scotland because of a policy i never knew about? |  | ""We take all reasonable steps to minimise any disruption to your journey. In the event that our services are delayed or cancelled we will endeavour to notify you of the delay and any alternative timetable as soon as possible. | We will contact customers using the email address provided at the point of sale, where possible."" |  | ""In the event of a cancellation or delay exceeding 120 minutes, we shall refund any fare paid and take reasonable steps to transport the passenger to their destination."" |  | That was from thesame policy booklet that states that we must have waited 120minutes so why do you have to allow me give a negative feedback? I enjoyed the last trip i had from leeds to london but you failed to do the right thing by resolving my concern when it was clearly your fault. |  | I am not happy that you have to make me do this review when we have both established the time and i sent my map movement with time stamp to show how long i waited and when i left with another bus but that was not still enough for you. |  | I have decided to bypass using your service for this reason and i hope others who has similar experience can come up and speak about this so that this policy can be changed as it is not going to make the brand acceptable to every of its customers. |  | There is no way i could confirm that bus came around withing 120mins but it is my word against theirs since i left with another bus to meet up with my job."

Stood in the cold streets late at night as it was supposed to be coming at 00:15am and appeared at 1:15am. Absolute joke freezing and vunerable 17 year olds left in streets we didn’t know, motorbikes coming and attempting a hit and run. Overall worst bus provider i’ve ever been a part of bus toilet stinks of pis and poo aswell no cleaners and also if u reserve seats it doesn’t even matter because u have random people sleeping over your seats (YOU HAVE TO PAY EXTRA TO RESERVE SEATS SCAMMING PEOPLE) so i hope the company enjoys my wasted £16 pound all together in reserving 4 seats for my ride. Also the lack of information on where the bus stop is led me and my friends to have to ask multiple people whether they were on our bus and staff at leeds city bus station who were actually helpful other than any staff member ive ever conversed with at mega bus. Flippin scam get the flix bus or national express if u want a coach, honestly the high train prices are better to pay at this rate. Worse company ever. Experience was awful cheers"

Megabus,1-Star Review for Megabus:,1,,2024-09-25T14:04:15.000Z,"I had a terrible experience on my recent Megabus trip. The coach had no toilet, and we arrived at my destination almost an hour late. When I asked the driver a question, he was rude and dismissive. We were told we’d have to switch coaches because the toilet was broken, but that never happened. We were instructed to take all our belongings off the bus, only to wait for a coach that never arrived. The entire situation was poorly handled, and the lack of communication made the trip incredibly stressful. I wouldn’t recommend this service to anyone."
Megabus,Coach was comfortable and drivers/staff…,4,,2024-09-25T11:15:26.000Z,"Coach was comfortable and drivers/staff helpful and efficient as I got on and off. I do wish, however, that drivers under instruction/supervision would refrain from personal chatter at the top of their voices throughout long journeys with their mentor/friend. I moved back on my second journey but could not escape the constant, loud conversation - most of it not about the job in hand and much about other colleagues. Very annoying."

Megabus,Where to get bus,4,,2024-09-24T17:28:40.000Z,"Mostly have no issue with Megabus cheap cheerful ect, even though our trip from Manchester to Portsmouth yesterday had a few issues and we arrived over an hour late again these things happen, but the problem is that you are using a temp stop in Portsmouth and the road it's on isn't exactly a short road and was a struggle to get to the ferry but worst of all, we don't have a clue where we get the return journey from! Is it going to be across from the premier inn?"
Megabus,Not advised.,2,,2024-09-23T10:27:15.000Z,"My experience overall was extremely poor. | Firstly, Megabus cancelled my return trip only 5 days before I was due to leave for my holiday. The rescheduled trip was far from ideal and meant a longer, less convenient journey, necessitating an additional overnight hotel stay and associated meal costs. I had no time to realistically find an alternative. | Of the four legs of the journey, two were acceptable but two were extremely sub standard. | The trip from Sunderland to Victoria was fine. The trip from Victoria to Heathrow was extremely poor. The bus driver was agressive and threatening. He told passengers that he would personally throw any bags on seats out of the window!! | I had booked the two front seats ( £2 each) but couldn’t use them because they were occupied by what appeared to be the driver’s belongings!! More worryingly, the driver used some very abusive language about other road users. Even more disturbing was his lack of care and attention. He was actually filling in some paperwork while driving the vehicle and spent most of the journey from Victoria to Heathrow with one hand and arm outside the window!!! | The journey from Heathrow to Oxford ( apart from not being what I had previously booked) was excellent. The bus driver was courteous and skillful. The only question here was why I’d paid £2 per seat as a reservation fee, when there were no reserved seats. | The final leg of my journey was again most unacceptable. It began ( late) with the driver announcing that luggage space was very tight, that individual allowance was one 10 kg bag and anyone with heavier bags should purchase an additional seat- I imagine someone downstairs on the bus challenged this ( quite correctly because this statement completely contradicts Megabus policy) and he did not repeat this, just blaming the increasing lateness of the bus on having to load bags. | More worryingly, the seat allocated to me was broken and the seat back would not remain in an upright position and I had to make the entire journey ( nearly two hours longer than it should have been) with the seat back in the reclined mode."

Checked the website which said that the coach had departed at 12:46. Rang Megabus for clarity and they said the driver is taking a 45 minute break. Ended up departing at about 13:55. |  | I understand driving regulations, however, why schedule the coach at the same time as the drivers scheduled break? And if there was traffic or something, why don’t you simply update the website to prevent people from stressing. Ended up having to call in. The call queue was that long I considered just ditching the coach for a train. |  | To add to this point, this is a coach to Manchester Airport. You’d think punctuality might be taken a bit serious when the destination is an airport, surely?!"
Megabus,First and last time,1,,2024-09-20T13:30:53.000Z,"Firstly the bus was late leaving meaning we were then late arriving in Glasgow. Should have had around 10-15 mins or so to see my partner's daughter before she got on her bus but her bus pulled out as ours went in. The driver was constantly putting his foot on and off the brake even though there was nothing in front of him, almost 4 hours of this had us both feeling rather sick by the time we got off. The floor under the seat where I put my bag was soaking wet which may mean I now have wet clothes for the weekend, and chewing gum stuck to the handle on the seat."
Megabus,Excellent very helpful,5,,2024-09-19T17:52:52.000Z,"Excellent very helpful, as a disabled person was a little nervous as I was on my own but they could not of been more helpful"

Megabus,you cancelled the coach that you only…,1,,2024-09-19T12:11:12.000Z,"you cancelled the coach that you only informed me about via email and it was still visible on my account, so I was stuck with a transfer in Bristol and missed my flight in London"

Megabus,Uncomfortable journey through out.,2,,2024-09-18T17:44:48.000Z,"Ridiculous. I’ve been on megabus before, never been such a major problem as I had on 14th September on my way to Leicester. Please can passengers be aware that when paying for reservation there’s a more chance you’ve wasted you’re reservation fee for no reason as it’s completely packed and people sit wherever the hell they want and the useless bus drivers don’t give a s***t they just tell you sit anywhere available. Drivers need to understand that if seats are reserved then keep them bloody empty it’s simple as that. Why am I paying for seats that other people are taking? I had one bus driver on megabus in the past where made sure no one sat on reservation seats unless you showed him that you paid for it! Absolutely brilliant. |  | I was uncomfortable and crammed. Upsetting and unreliable. I don’t blame the bus I blame the bus drivers lack of care to give a damn. |  | I paid money for strangers to use my seats cos drivers don’t care about their job, they are too tired!"
Megabus,Stop the bus!,1,,2024-09-18T17:39:35.000Z,"The driver was a bit short with the passengers who didn’t have booked seats, he could’ve of been more friendly and helpful. The drivers also missed my stop and had to go to the next motorway junction and turn around. If I’d been asleep I would have probably ended up in Glasgow. I was an hour late into Carlisle in the end."

Megabus,Bus ride ok,3,,2024-09-18T17:14:35.000Z,Bus ride ok . As expected for a cheap bus ticket. However the strong smell of pee coming from the toilet was terrible. Apparently they had ran out of water. At one point the pee was spilling over making it impossible to use the toilet. Not good on a long journey ( 9 plus hours) . The bus was on time on my journey down to Oxford but was approximately 40 mins late to come back . I was supposed to get off at Sunderland but I couldn't stand the smell any longer and by that time needed the toilet so I got off at Middlesbrough and made my way home from there.

Megabus,Booking a seat,1,,2024-09-18T10:23:53.000Z,I reserved and paid for a seat on the return journey from Manchester. Unfortunately the driver had his coat and bag on my seat. I mentioned it to him and he dismissed my request to move his personal belongings. I was advised to move to another seat. This caused an argument with the passenger whose seat I occupied.

Nice to see some new rolling stock (Volvo Plaxton24 plate) My thanks to the drivers on both journeys. No dramas, reliable and efficient. I often get my leg pulled on why I choose to take the coach rather than the plane or the train ? I’m told I could fly across the Atlantic in the time it takes the coach to arrive in Aberdeen, it’s not just about the budget I’m on but more importantly, quite frankly it’s the unreliability of the rail and airline industry since Covid and the hanging around just drives me mad. I get on the coach at London Victoria with no messing about. The wheels just keep on turning.

On the website, the price is the same, but when you buy directly, you add another £3 or more at the time of purchase and motivate it because it is an online sale! No dear! This is fraud!

Megabus,"Coach arrived on time, that’s the only good point.",1,,2024-09-16T03:41:53.000Z,"Coach arrived on time, drivers were polite but language used was inappropriate, not appropriately dressed considering it’s a coach company they’re just wearing T-shirts with a hivis over the top. Since stagecoach got removed the standards have massively dropped, coach maintenance is poor, seats don’t stay in upright position and handles have been snapped off which is a safety hazard. Drivers don’t announce the stops to passengers and are more concerned about getting their puff off their vape instead. I will be enquiring whether these coaches are classed as roadworthy as I don’t seem to think they are with the consistent clanking that these are making along the journey, some sort of checks should be done on your “operators” to make sure that they’re looking after their coaches your customers are now not getting cheap and simple like Megabus used to be. |  | What a shame, Megabus used to be a great company and it’s now a shambles."

As expected from your team read the terms and conditions of expect to wait for 2 hours for a refund. No gesture of goodwill to repay one of the 2 amounts I had to pay your company.

Not wanting to disturb the co-driver I waited patiently till he was passing by me to ask about the situation. He was convinced all was well until he got there and IMMEDIATELY he started trying fix it and restore it, and to come back to tell me to try to use it until the next destination. Very great workers in such a difficult situation. I was also worried about the long drive but its really great for such a reasonable price I honestly might ditch the trains and the planes now!"
Megabus,Great value,4,,2024-09-10T11:32:30.000Z,"This service is great value for money. The last journey was an overnight stopping service Glasgow to London. The stops were noisy - raised voice from the driver and lights full on, but the temperature was good, not too hot which can be a killer. Wear layers so you can peel off or cover up. All in all excellent value."

I was travelling with 81 year old mother. The Bus then turned up. Won't refund money only offered voucher which is no good. Escalating complaint as I don't think would use again
Megabus,My journey from Manchester to London…,1,,2024-09-10T11:21:59.000Z,"My journey from Manchester to London (Finchley Road) was changed from Monday to Sunday. The original journey is around 4 hours. The new journey took close to 6 hours. This is not what I paid for. If I knew it I would use a different bus company. The departure time was late. The departure spot has no clear signs of departure. | The journey from London to Manchester was also not good. The driver was playing loud music, and the temperature was way too cold. | In both journeys there were no announcements for passengers to not play loud music on the bus. | And when there was loud music from passengers, the driver didn't do anything about it (Unlike what happens in other bus companies) | I am extremely disappointed from your company. It used to be better in the past. | I really hope that it will improve, as I'm starting to doubt if I will use it at the near future."

The driver was helpful and friendly. | The bus itself was ok for comparatively short distances, ours was 2-3 hours but I wouldn’t want to be on it any longer due to lack of leg room. About the same as an economy flight! But overall for the price I would recommend MegaBus."
Megabus,The staff were friendly and helpful.,5,,2024-09-10T11:16:30.000Z,"The staff were friendly and helpful. | The bus was clean and comfortable. | The cost of the ticket was excellent value | My only criticism is that the toilet does get messy the longer the journey goes on so it can be very unpleasant to use, I think that it should be cleaned several times while on route. | All in all I would certainly recommend Megabus."

Megabus,Reasonably punctual but noisy devices,4,,2024-09-10T11:07:20.000Z,Reasonably punctual. | Too much noise from devices ie videos - the driver (who also can hear the noise) should really reinforce 'use headphones' policy.

Megabus,Unclean Coach Toilet,1,,2024-09-10T11:01:23.000Z,"Mega Bus is fantastic coach but my last trip on 4th of Sept, from London to Cardiff was unpleasant due to the toilet. Firstly, the bus arrived late, which was understandable due to heavy traffic within London but an uncleaned toilet with a bad odur made our trip worst. | The smell from the bus toilet was terrible throughout the entire 3:55hrs trip. Please we would appreciate if more attention can be given to all buses toilet before departure, most especially trips from 14:00 to 18:00. |  | Thanks."
Megabus,Worst customer support,1,,2024-09-10T10:53:02.000Z,"This is actually 1st time me using megabus. I had worst experience. I have reached there and tried calling someone to open doors as the bus was still there but there was no one to respond. Bus left. Even after that there was no staff member to speak to. No amendment for the next bus. After an hour I saw someone n went to speak with him that I’ve missed the bus. His response shocked me, he said take a train or national express as that’s the only option left for you. If that is the case why should we choose megabus. Better to choose national express or flux so that we will have a proper customer support."

Bus was supposed to arrive at Park Place, Cardiff at 6.35am. But it was late for 1 hour and I missed the interview. Moreover, I took paid day off from my work. So a total loss of around £220. When I asked for refund of my return bus fair at least, I was denied. So shocking. Will never trust megabus again. Also my friends amd families are going to quit megabus."

Megabus,Theft and fraud,1,,2024-09-09T19:34:53.000Z,"I decided to change my tickets to another destination 1 month before departure. Not only do they not have a cancellation policy. Greetings from the 19th century, apparently this is how the owner of this business thinks. My old tickets cost 92 pounds, the new ones were 61.83 and I had to pay an extra 3.75 to change the booking. Of course, they steal the difference."
Megabus,The worst bus company I ever drive,1,,2024-09-09T19:24:10.000Z,"The worst bus company I ever drive, air con doesn’t work, fully of the people, not even able to open any window, smelly with no space to put feet down, when I wrote complain, they said nothing they can do about it, after paying £30 for bus, I would recommend you national express but never megabus."
Megabus,What a poor service at Heathrow Central Bus Station,1,,2024-09-09T10:48:40.000Z,"I arrived the Bus Station at 7am and waited for the 10:55am MegaBus to Birmingham. | When it was 10:45am, my family moved all the luggage from the waiting hall to the outside. I kept asking (at least 3 times) the staff outside where was my bus? The staff kept saying it was not yet come until it was 11am, I asked another staff who said your bus was leaving NOW. He tried to stop it but the bus gone away, I was forced to buy another set tickets costs £140 (National Bus). | The MegaBus has no bus number on it, you can't easy trace them and my case was my bus is not terminate at Birmingham, it was terminated at Liverpool. The bus was shown to Liverpool only on the front, you have to get really close to the bus to find out. Also the MegaBus schedule is not shown on the waiting hall, you have to check by yourself outside. No more MegaBus, it's done. |  | The reply is from a robot I assumed. This can fit in any bad reviews. | You can go to the Heathrow Central Bus Station by yourself and see how difficult it is to find the right bus. | There is NO bus number on the booking confirmation but MegaBus has a bus number! What is the point? | Yes, there is a destination place on the bus but you have to figure it out from maybe 300 metres away?! Also you have to have the power to see through other buses because they parked so close. | No MegaBus information on the waiting room but they DO have NationalExpress bus information. Why? This is the bus station issue, yeah I got it."
Megabus,I recently encountered an awful experience,1,,2024-09-08T11:38:39.000Z,"I recently encountered a misunderstanding with my Megabus booking, where I missed my scheduled bus as it was operated by a different company (Scottish Citylink), something I was not aware of at the time. As a result, I had to purchase an additional ticket. I reached out to Megabus customer service to kindly request a refund for one of the tickets, explaining the situation and providing proof. While I fully understand and respect their non-refundable policy, I hoped my unique circumstances might be reconsidered. |  | The responses I received were polite and adhered strictly to the terms and conditions. However, I was hoping for a bit more flexibility given the situation. While I appreciate the clear communication, it would have been a great gesture of goodwill if they had taken my case into account. Overall, I respect their policies but was left a little disappointed that my request wasn’t considered on a more individual basis."

Megabus,Victoris Bus Station Nightmare,2,,2024-10-25T16:53:00.000Z,"I reserved a ticket on the July 27th bus from Gatwick Airport to Derby. The bus turned up at the airport on time, but right from the start, the driver was aggressive, seemed in a very bad mood, and told myself and the other 3 passengers something about Victoria that we could not understand (as he wasn't a native speaker of English). |  | The bus set off through central London, which I know well from having lived there, and I recognised we were going to Victoris Bus Station. I assumed we were making an extra stop to pick up passengers, but no - instead, the driver unloaded our luggage in a car park, pointed in the direction of the bus station, told us to go there for another bus, then drove off! He literally abandoned us in a car park! |  | Myself and the other passengers (a lady from Nigeria and her two kids) made our way to the bus station, which though only a 5-minute walk, was exhausting in the heat and with a lot of luggage. The station was packed, and when we went to the Megabus office, the man there explained that due to demonstrations in central London, many of the roads were closed and all of the traffic in and out of London was severely disrupted. In the end, we had to wait hours in the bus station until they could get us onto another bus. |  | Obviously, the traffic problem wasn't the fault of Megabus, and both the man in the ticket office and the driver of the second bus (when it finally came) were both very nice. The issue I have is with the first bus driver who was so rude, and whoever it was (either that driver or his manager) who decided that instead of informing us of the full situation with the traffic disruption when the bus arrived at Gatwick Airport, we would be taken to and dumped at Victoria Bus Station without explanation. If the situation had been explained while we were still at Gatwick, I wouldn't have boarded the bus - instead, I'd have checked into the hotel at Gatwick North Terminal and traveled up to Derby the next day, as by that time I'd already been traveling for 33 hours straight without sleep and was completely exhausted. By not informing us of the situation, the driver deprived us of the ability to make that choice. I'm 56 and not in good health at the best of times. As it was, I felt so ill after being dumped at Victoria Bus Station that I honestly felt like I was going to collapse. The heat was unbearable because for security reasons, they kept all the doors closed unless a bus was actually boarding, and it was so crowded that there was nowhere to sit. |  | I won't be using Megabus again. I don't want to risk repeating that nightmare trip. |  | Edit: I forgot to add that even though I paid extra to book a front row seat, the driver told me I couldn't sit there - he had all his belongings strewn over the front two rows and made us sit in the middle. It seems from the reviews that a lot of passengers have had the same problem - they paid extra to reserve seats, then didn't get the seat they paid for."
Megabus,Pick up location changed.,4,,2024-09-06T13:05:32.000Z,"Missed the bus to the airport as pickup location has changed in Exeter to the park and ride, luckily we found someone to give us a lift. | Bus driver from the airport on pickup (1040hrs) was so lovely, friendly and helpful to everyone. The bus (54211) was leaking water with all the wet weather, so the driver blocked these seats off."
Megabus,This is totally disheartening,1,,2024-09-06T10:24:57.000Z,"This is totally disheartening, my experience is of not different from everyone else, I had a bus booked for 8:30am to Glasgow and it’s almost half 9 already, the bus isn’t here yet and now the bus arrived, only for us to check in and notice the USB charging ports are not working.

Megabus,"The bus is already delayed, driver was rude, seating issues",1,,2024-09-05T10:09:22.000Z,"The bus was already delayed. The driver was so rude to us. Another issue was we have already reserved 3 Seats, 5,9 and 10. | While booking there were seats available (9,10) but when we went on board, there were no seats. We asked driver, he said rudely, sit anywhere we are already late. | This was not our mistake that bus was late. We paid extra to reserve seat so that we can sit together. It was very bad experience. This was the first time we booked megabus and I won’t book again."

No toilet roll in toilet and do not flush. |  | Return journey was delayed due to the coach driver breaking the disabled lift whilst people were watching taking if a passenger. 2 sets of engineers were called out so delay was nearly 4 hrs later. We then had to wait at Cambridge for another coach driver who was 30 mins late. |  | Very disappointed.
Megabus,Hot experience in megabus,1,,2024-09-04T00:25:30.000Z,"The bus from Bristol to London was too hot. Inside was 33 degrees. It is not usual as this was not my first time to take megabus. Before, I like megabus but this hot experience makes me to think twice next time."

Megabus,Mega bus,2,,2024-09-03T21:42:45.000Z,I Used the mega bus to manchester very uncomfortable with unfulfilled promises. No.1 There was no Wifi at all No. 2 the charging sockets didn’t even work only the USB ones . The was no comfortable sleeping spot .The arrival time was 1 hour after it was meant to be. But the pros were they were prompt .
Megabus,Soso MegabusI,3,,2024-09-03T21:23:11.000Z,"I travelled return from Newcastle to Leicester.The outward journey was good with minimal delays & the bus actually arrived at it's destination a few minutes early. The return journey was, again, not good. The bus was about 75 minutes late leaving the pick-up point & the coach was chilly. They did shorten the journey by decanting passengers for Sunderland onto the bus behind & taking those remaining straight to Newcastle. I was impressed however as I had occasion to change my booking the day before returning & it was quick, easy & relatively inexpensive to do online."
Megabus,One Leg Excellent; One Leg Awful,4,,2024-09-03T21:13:01.000Z,"We travelled from Heathrow to Wellington, Somerset on Megabus (August 23, 2024). | The first leg from Heathrow to Bristol was not enjoyable. The driver was vocal, drove aggressively, and unhelpful. We arrived late, due to traffic, but that didn't excuse the poor behaviour. | The second leg from Bristol to Wellington (onward to Plymouth) was a completely different story. Despite also being late, the driver was courteous, communicative regarding what was going on with traffic on the M5, and worked with other bus drivers on the route to help them out. Thank you second bus driver!"

Megabus,Pleasant drivers,4,,2024-09-03T20:28:52.000Z,"Pleasant drivers, very clean buses, easy to get on and off, only downside was the driver handover was delayed one way, so made further connections difficult, also wish had more local to me pick ups"
Megabus,Our first trip on a Megabus,5,,2024-09-03T20:00:51.000Z,"Our first trip on a Megabus. Very pleasant trip to and from Sheffield, we enjoyed the experience. We did find it a little untoward that, on the return journey, the driver told people boarding at Sheffield to sit anywhere. This led to some confusion and arguments. If we pay to reserve a seat the seat should be available and the driver should enforce this. On the way down we were unavoidably delayed due to roadworks. An App with live updates and revised ETA would be an advantage. Logging into the website is cumbersome. On the plus side, we found the journey pleasant and value for money."

The return journey wasn't much better, got a national express coach instead of a megabus then we all had to get off and change a Sheffield to the megabus which was comfortable the rest of the way home but the toilet was absolutely disgusting, flooded and stunk the whole bus out"

Both pick up and destination times are always late, I have reserved a seat but never got it due to the coach seats not being numbered. There has been a few occasions where you could smell the toilet throughout the bus, a woman actually used the toilet and she said it made her eyes water. Oh yeah, the wi-fi never works and the charger points are hit and miss. | Not a happy customer | Pathetic service."
Megabus,The bus didn’t turn up,1,,2024-09-03T18:04:22.000Z,"The bus didn’t turn up (Leicester to London). The tracker stopped and all passengers had no notification what had happened or whether it would turn. Luckily, after an hour or do, another Megabus turned up going to Newcastle. The driver dodn’t know anything about our bus bus was very helpful. He contacted the control centre and a cab was arrange to transport the passengers to London. Not ideal as no toilets, cramped and not as professional or safe as Megabus drivers. But at least we got to London… hours late. To date, no apology or contact. Very poor!!"
Megabus,"Was very disappointed, issue resolved",1,,2024-09-04T15:12:42.000Z,Seats that are booked and paid for in advance not available. When I asked the driver his retort was - complain by email. Toilets were absolutely disgusting. Driver on the trip from London to Bristol spoke on his mobile for half the journey. | Booked seat for that trip was so close to the seat in front of it that I couldn't fit my knees in the space. | I used to love Megabus. | Edit: Megabus responded immediately very positively and has refunded the booked fee.

Both these factors contributed to Megabus going to the bottom of my list when booking on this route again."

Megabus,"Unreliable, stressful and costly experience.",1,,2024-08-29T18:12:17.000Z,"Booked a return fare from Wellington to Heathrow and had trouble on both legs of the journey. From Wellington to Heathrow, trip up to Bristol was fine but at Bristol we joined the queue for the bus to Heathrow and waited for over half an hour only to find out that the bus being used was an Euro Coach but nowhere was this documented on our ticket nor did the driver inform the queue of over 20 people that his bus was the Megabus service to Heathrow. As a result of this we had to use the train from Temple Meads to Heathrow, an extra cost of approx £108. Wrote to Megabus and they eventually refunded me £59.52. On the return leg, there were no problems from Heathrow to Bristol but after waiting for over half an hour we were informed by a Megabus driver that our bus had broken down at Bristol Airport and we would have to wait for the next scheduled bus which was in about an hour's time. Having just completed an overnight long haul flight my family and I didn't want to stand around for an hour so caught the train from Bristol Temple Meads to Taunton and had to contact family to inform them we needed picking up from Taunton rather than Wellington. Again we had to fork out extra money for the Train fare but this time after contacting Megabus I was informed that there would be no refund but was offered a Voucher to use within a year. What a joke, there is no way I will be using Megabus again as the service I received was unreliable, stressful and cost me twice as much. Avoid like the plague is my advice to potential travellers looking for a reliable and stress free journey. Gave one Star as was unable to give 0."

Luckily it's only an hour trip and it was kind of bearable. All started with the driver just throwing cases from a distance. When I've asked to do it myself I was told no and of course he throw it even harder just to prove his point. Going on the bus, it was like entering a sauna. 26 degrees outside, with bright scorching uk sun and no air con. I get it he probably wanted to climatise us for the warm weather holiday but still. In the so called third world country you get a better service."

From the start the bus was running late & the driver not very reassuring by telling me that continuing my trip onto my final destination at a certain point it was not guaranteed I would be able to complete my journey. As an O.A.P. I felt concerned not knowing how my trip was to go & what time I might finally arrive... | He said it was due to redundancies being made & drivers not turning up for duty-not really what I wanted to hear.. Eventually I got to my final destination in the dark & approx 90 mins late & my lift home had not arrived due to lack of information I could give. | I am aggrieved as this company seems to be slipping in customer satisfaction as it was only recently on another trip that I encountered issues that did result in a satisfactory outcome so gave them another go... | Not sure they will be my first choice going forward!!
Megabus,Picked up exactly as scheduled,5,,2024-08-27T20:18:20.000Z,Picked up exactly as scheduled. Dropped off only 10 minutes late whitch is reasonable considering it included travelling though London rush hour traffic.

By the time that the coach arrived at its destination I was absolutely busting and in agony. I really thought that I was going to have an embarrassing accident. | On my return journey, the driver, unlike the one on my outward one, made several announcements, one of which was in connection to the toilet door. He went to a considerable amount of trouble to literally beg passengers to not slam the door as that would result in the locking mechanism becoming stuck and therefore rendering it unusable for anyone on the coach. He added that the issue could be resolved by his pulling over mid-journey but that would not be an option in this case as he only had one key that he was not going to release to passengers as it would leave him without one. | If this is a regular occurrence on Megabus coaches then it stands to reason that a sign should be placed on the toilet door itself. This should alleviate any issues occurring from passengers who have not heard the announcement from the driver in addition to giving him one thing less to think about while concentrating on the driving. | On another matter, my return journey was nearly one hour late which I find astounding to say the least. As a consequence of this I was left with less than ten minutes to make my connecting bus which, had I missed it, would have resulted in my having to wait two hours for the next one."

Driver was absolutely lovely so he gets 5* the bus itself was difficult to sit on with little leg room seat 6 and the toilet was way to small. If you are elderly or disabled or a big on the tubby side (I'm size 16) then it's near on impossible to use. The bus was delayed massively due to traffic so driver had to take the legal 45min break. Like I say he was lovely, safe driving etc but the bus needs updating. No plugs so couldn't charge my phone at all. Bus on the way back 4.25pm Cardiff uni to London Victoria on sunday 25th August, again lovely driver but seats not enough leg room and the USB chargers didn't work for my phone at all.

Prior to making this decision, an M82 bus came, I approached the driver but insisted i wait for my bus to come, hence the reason I decided to leave at 17:55 in order to catch a train to my destination beacuse I have a 7am job to resume the following day. |  | I wrote your customer service and called but they denied and insisted I will never get a refund for the bus or compensation for my train ticket. |  | Just for your information, this will be the last time I will board, or my friends or any of my family members will board your bus. |  | Thank you |  | Bolaji Adebiyi"

Megabus,Service departed early leaving me stranded,1,,2024-08-27T10:29:36.000Z,"I booked a Megabus from Bristol Airport to Manchester, thinking that this would be a simple way of doing the journey for me as it was one provider for the whole journey. The stop at Bristol Airport doesn't have any seating nearby so despite having arrived over an hour early, I had to wait out of site of the stop. When I went back to the stop a few minutes before my bus was due I saw the bus pulling away from the stop. In order to avoid further impact on my journey I had to take an expensive taxi to catch my connection instead. |  | I raised my issue with customer services but they were adamant that the bus left at the scheduled time and so they were unable to help me. Unfortunately I found going with this no frills provider a false economy on this occasion and won't be planning to travel with them again any time soon."
Megabus,AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE,1,,2024-08-26T12:52:55.000Z,"Waited for bus yesterday from Perth bus station to Edinburgh, which ended up being 131 minutes late apparently. Had to just go home as I would have missed a performance at Edinburgh Playhouse which I had a ticket for by the time that the bus would have gotten there. | Contacted Megabus and asked to be refunded for the ticket price for the performance, which they refused to do. How abysmal!! Absolute joke of a company, who I believe are owned by Stagecoach so that says it all, eg shocking state of bus services in Perth/Perthshire. AVOID THIS COMPANY LIKE THE PLAGUE."
Megabus,Awful,2,,2024-08-26T12:05:58.000Z,"What the actual hell is the customer service all about I was on the phone waiting for 20 minutes to get told they can’t help me there and then the guy Matthew hung up on me mid conversation, needless to say I’m fuming."
Megabus,"Delayed journey, varied reasons, poor customer service",2,,2024-08-26T11:32:38.000Z,"On Saturday 24 August I travelled from Plymouth to Oxford on a pre-bought ticket. | The first leg of the journey from Plymouth to Bristol was very good. The driver was very friendly and we left on time at 6am. | The journey was smooth and relatively comfortable and we arrived on time. | However the same definitely cannot be said for the second leg of the journey. | There was a delay which meant passengers had to wait in the rain for 35 minutes. | The representative at the bus stop was friendly and helpful but everyone had to go and ask him for an update instead of him proactively letting us know what was happening. He informed us several times there would be a delay of 15 minutes. He said this was due to driver working hour conditions. | The bus finally left Bristol at 11:10 instead of 10:35. The driver apologised for the delay and explained this was due to circumstances out of their control yesterday - surely, if the circumstances on Friday which affected this journey on Saturday, plans could have been put in place to avoid the delay?! Surely there are relief drivers to cover these types of incidents? | There was no further communication from the driver at all after this point. | The bus finally arrived in Oxford at 13:15, this 55 minutes late! Again no apology from the driver. | To add to the pain of the journey the phone chargers were not working. | When contacting Megabus customer services they said there was no issue on the Friday but that there was a technical issue with the bus on the Saturday. | Presumably they don’t have any back-up buses for these circumstances, must be a smaller company than I thought. | At least 2 of the 3 reasons must have been made up as there can only be one true reason. | They said they were sympathetic but no part refunds are considered unless the journey is 120 minutes or more late. | The response made no mention of the phone chargers not working. | The reply was also addressed to “Dear Customer”, I found this quite rude and lazy when I had provided my full name. | There are so many good alternatives available that I won’t be using Megabus again."
Megabus,Arrives late and horrible urine smell,2,,2024-08-25T19:10:10.000Z,"I've had to use this service about 4 times in the last few weeks and 3 times they were late, making me miss my connecting transports. The worst part of the whole experience is they all have this putrid urine smell. It's so bad my throat hurts. I am writing this review in one of their buses currently as I can't stand the smell. Surely they should be able to do something about cleaning the toilet up. Other coach services don't smell as bad."

Megabus,"Drunk passengers, delay, toilet/charger/air con do not work, NO REFUNDS …",1,,2024-08-24T14:39:54.000Z,"Experienced huge delays before setting off. Once we had set off we were informed we will be having a driver change however, the Megabus driver did not turn up -we waited an hour outside before boarding the same coach we got off. Megabus says they only refund a journey with delays if the journey was delayed by 120 minutes or more. Understandably, sometimes delays occur but 2 hours is insane. Every ticket I have purchased (over 20) has been delayed by an hour or more. No air con working, half the time the chargers do not work and recently the toilet didn’t work. No consideration for their customers. National express and Flixbus are great alternatives somewhat similar pricing, a coach card with National express grants a huge discount on tickets. Flixbus are very very reliable and rarely ever delayed. |  | I was very disappointed by the lack of resolution for an appalling experience with this service where a few passengers were drunk, verbally abusive and racist towards me. I can experience social anxiety frequently which is why this experience was even more distressing. As a young lady this made me feel very unsafe. Hoping others are aware of this. Even with the terrible experience and major delay Megabus said they cannot refund me, did not compensate me at all or even offer a discount for future bookings. |  | I have been a frequent customer with the company but found their policies do not consider a consumer at all. Great customer service but a very selfish unreliable company. Would highly recommend using Flixbus and National Express -only a few pounds difference in tickets but 100 times better than Megabus. :)"
