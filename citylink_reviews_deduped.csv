Citylink,Wish you could lower the steps on/off…,3,,2025-04-02T19:33:19.000Z,Wish you could lower the steps on/off the bus. It’s difficult for people with mobility issues to access the buses and I find myself limiting the amount of times I use citylink coaches because of this. The 902 today had myself and 4 others all using walking aids and we all struggled getting on and off some more than others.
Citylink,This is the worst coach company I have…,1,,2025-04-02T18:45:58.000Z,"This is the worst coach company I have ever used; I wish I had read the reviews on Trustpilot. |  | I travelled from Aberdeen to Edinburgh on Tuesday, 25 March 2025. On my way back, when I boarded the bus at Edinburgh bus station, the driver made some serious racist remarks. When boarding the bus, the scanner didn't work, so the driver couldn't scan the tickets; then he scanned my concession card instead of my return ticket. The driver didn't see my return ticket either, which was on the next page of the printout, and when I told him that it was on the next page and showed him, he said, ""I don't understand your foreign accent,"" not knowing that I also have a slight speech problem. |  | Also, there were two seats behind the driver, and when I kindly asked him if I could sit there instead of climbing upstairs on the bus since I have injured hands, especially the left hand which awaits surgery for a plate removal from the wrist, which is causing a lot of pain and discomfort due to surgical error, and also had a sore knee, but it is slowly getting better (I didn't dare to tell him that due to his behaviour, which I found somewhat intimidating), he said, ""Not for foreign people."" Hearing that, I was really shocked and embarrassed but didn't dare to ask him why he said that, just in case he didn't understand me and may get aggressive, so I decided to better deal with it at the Aberdeen bus station by reporting the incident to the local manager to avoid any further embarrassment or delaying the departure. |  | So, at arrival, I reported him to the stance manager at Aberdeen bus station that very day. The next day I lodged a complaint with Citylink and also asked the Stagecoach data controller for the CCTV footage on 28 March 2025, but miraculously, which I personally find incredibly astonishing, at that very particular time and location, a recording fault occurred, so the CCTV footage is UNAVAILABLE. |  | They think that I am that naive who believes anything, but not so. They can fool themselves, but despite being a foreigner, they cannot fool me. I am still waiting to hear from Citylink, but I doubt very much that my complaint will be dealt with fairly simply because they would rather protect their reputation than take action. Sadly, decency, respect and fairness have retired; this is Citylink and Stagecoach, the very brands you can certainly and wholeheartedly trust; welcome on board, but remember those seats behind the driver, which are not for foreign people."
Citylink,Smart Thinking....Citylinking,5,,2025-04-02T14:07:43.000Z,Recently come off a trip with Citylink on Friday and was surprised about how punctual they were coming from Aberdeen to Glasgow
Citylink,Comfortable journey but no Wi-Fi,3,,2025-04-01T12:33:10.000Z,"Comfortable journey, quality seating and power charging for mobile. No Wi-Fi which is poor needed these days for travelling customers"

Citylink,"A quick, regular and convenient way to travel to Glasgow",5,,2025-03-30T14:30:51.000Z,"A convenient quick regular service to Glasgow, thanks to the driver today who stopped for us as we ran to the bus stop at Ratho Station. 😃"
Citylink,edinburgh airport,4,,2025-03-29T12:46:58.000Z,"Arrived at edinburgh airport late night, unable to access on line time table, for the Air 900 service. | app did not appear to be working, no timetables at the bus stop. Once on the bus difficult to navigate where I was as the on board tracking system was not on. | I had to go and ask the driver if he was stopping at Eurocentral. Thankfully he was. The journey itself was good but the online facilities should be available."
Citylink,Very comfortable journey from Glasgow…,5,,2025-03-21T18:38:44.000Z,Very comfortable journey from Glasgow Buchanan street Bus Station to Maybury Edinburgh. Very courteous Driver. | Superb
Citylink,Heart attack Walk,1,,2025-03-21T10:52:14.000Z,"The busses are great, even without a toilet. I can manage, even, at this stage of my life (75yrs) Some of your drivers are EXCELLENT....My complaint is:- | Cairnryan is a rural area. I have a 20 minute walk, in all weather's and darkness to my home. Why and I do mean WHY can't the 923 stop at the next available bus stop after Stena???? It is not a danger to any traffic and as an express bus, it has done its duty. ALL passengers arrive on time for the ferry. Let's pray you change the rules soon or the Scottish government change them... | Compliment:- your busses are as clean and efficient as German busses,which are also,efficient and CLEAN."
Citylink,Toilets,3,,2025-03-17T21:18:48.000Z,"I am very confused as to why your 923 service from Glasgow Buchanan St station to Cairnryan stena line port does not have a toilet on board. It's a 2hr 5 minute journey. You have use of a toilet on the 900 service from Glasgow to Edinburgh, thats only a 1 hour 10 minute journey. Please do not say that the toilet on the 900 service is locked off because it never is. I think that the 923 service that is provided is being is very discrimating against the public who have weak bladders, who can't have a drink of water on the journey without worrying that they may need the toilet."
Citylink,"Bus No Show, won't refund",1,,2025-03-13T15:24:50.000Z,"Booked tickets from Stirling to Glasgow, was at the bus stop 10 mins before and waited 20 minutes past when the bus was supposed to arrive. Tracking unavailable for this bus. After 20 minutes had to go and get the train. Contacted CityLink who are refusing to refund me because they are adamant the bus was running on time. Well the 5 of us who had booked tickets and waited beg to differ. Customer service point blank refusing to help with anything as the 'tracker' says the bus ran on time. Is that the same tracker that stated 'information unavailable' everytime I checked? | Will never use again, waste of time and totally unreliable."
Citylink,"Excellent service, clean windows make the journey",4,,2025-03-12T18:13:57.000Z,"Excellent service but on two of the last three journeys (Edinburgh to Inverness and back) the windows were very dirty, so no views. The last one, Inverness to Edinburgh, was wonderful, clean windows and made up time."
Citylink,Left people stranded,1,,2025-03-09T22:30:32.000Z,"I purchased two tickets for the 12:18 bus from Eurocentral to Murrayfield for the rugby, but when the bus arrived, it was already full. |  | The driver provided no assistance whatsoever. When I asked if he could at least radio the next bus to check for available seats, I was told there was nothing he could do. This raises the question—what is the point of being able to pre-purchase a ticket if it doesn’t guarantee a seat? |  | Even more concerning was the fact that two elderly women were left stranded, along with a young woman who was practically begging the driver to take her into Edinburgh for what seemed to be something important. |  | Overall, a very poor experience."
Citylink,Best trip of my life 🥺🥺,5,,2025-03-09T14:11:33.000Z,"Best trip of my life. The journey was sensational. So sanitary and lovely. The seats were very comfortable for my voluptuous posterior. The headrests smelled sweetly of a fresh lavender farm to my dreams. The tray table provided a suitable home for my hot pink Birkin bag and matching hot pink jumpsuit for my chihuahua. Overall a splendid experience, really met and raised my standards for the Scottish transport system. Much love, Gwendolyn Sandrina the 3rd of Cambridge, Texas. 🥰🫠🤗"

Citylink,Actual stop isn't updated,3,,2025-03-05T08:28:23.000Z,"Dear Citylink Customer Service, |  | I would like to bring to your attention an issue with booking tickets for the M9 coach service. I regularly take the M9 at 19:45 and 20:45 from Dundee to Perth, and I know that these services pass through Canal Street. However, when booking a ticket, the option for Canal Street does not appear, forcing me to book my ticket to Broxden Park and Ride instead. |  | Additionally, on my return journey, I board the coach from South Street without any issues. It would be helpful if the booking system reflected the actual stops the coach makes, allowing passengers to book directly for Canal Street. |  | I would appreciate it if you could look into this and update the system accordingly."
Citylink,Alex the Driver is a hero!,5,,2025-02-27T09:30:21.000Z,"The driver Alex who drives from Glasgow to Stranraer, is an absolute legend. When he learned that the ferry was cancelled, he offered to take me into Stranraer to let me get a proper lunch etc, and then drop me off at the terminal on the road back. Nothing was too much trouble to him, and he was a funny and helpful guy. A real credit to Citylink. Give this chap a raise!"

Helped to put our cases on coach | Aberdeen to Dundee (Tues 19th February 2025) | No idea which stand coach would leave from no citylink staff to ask or help (flix bus driver said it should be stance 1 but wasn't sure) when coach arrived just became free for all meaning although my partner and myself were there well before departure time,we were some of the last to board. Staff in Dundee apologised and helped us take our cases to the bus stance for our onward journey."

Citylink,Journey itself was fine,4,,2025-02-22T11:12:25.000Z,"Journey itself was fine. Bus was warm. Very seldom arrives at destination on time. Wasted time spent at scheduled stops, leaves much later than timetable. Queueing is free for all!!!"
Citylink,Cold journey,3,,2025-02-21T11:41:39.000Z,"Booked trip on earliest bus from Inverness to Glasgow. Bus departed on time and whole journey was on time and smooth. | The down side is that the bus was cold, only warming a bit when it stopped in Perth but got cold again when the journey recommenced and the blowers were on. I've used the early morning bus from Inverness to Glasgow several times and it is always very cold and the drivers don't seem to be able to regulate the temperature."
Citylink,Decline in services over recent period of time,2,,2025-02-21T11:30:24.000Z,"I use the service from Aberdeen to Glasgow and return once or twice a month and have been doing so for the past 3 years . | There has been an overall decline in services over these years due to various things :- | 1 ) Buses not leaving on time and lack of communication telling passengers why or when they will leave . | 2 ) Often uncontrolled temperature - sometimes boiling as heating on full blast or no heating at all . | 3) Several times floor has been awash with water with rainwater coming in from under bus . | 4) No internet- Can’t remember the last time I had internet . | 5) Charging points / plugs not working . | 6) Frequently now using unmarked single decked buses which are not designed for long journeys… ie no plugs/ chargers , no internet poor heating etc | ( I politely asked the driver the first time I was on one of these buses “ excuse me , are there no charging points or internet ? “ and his reply was “ It’s got an engine and 4 wheels … what you worried about?” | Charming ! And that left me speechless ! | This was my only bad experience with a driver as I usually find them pleasant and cheery … there was even one who sang! And none of the points I’ve made above are due to them . It’s the company that needs to pull its socks up and get buses back to modern day conditions and keep up with servicing them . | I have never actually complained to anyone about any of this but feel in this day and age passengers deserve better. I will honestly say if the train was cheaper I would use it ! I took it once when Megabuses were cancelled due to weather and the train was and was cosy and comfortable …. But too expensive ."
Citylink,Need to up their game,3,,2025-02-20T21:46:43.000Z,"Time keeping not great, some timetables are unachievable in rush hour traffic, especially between Perth and Glasgow. Total lack of staff and information now at bus stations. Need to rely on an app which gives general information - often inaccurate - and can't handle specific questions. | And some of your older coaches are looking shabby compared with new rivals Flixbus and Ember who I now prefer to use whenever possible"
Citylink,I enjoy going on the city link buses I…,5,,2025-02-20T21:44:43.000Z,I enjoy going on the city link buses I have traveled to a few places and they are comfortable and helpful drivers
Citylink,Reliable and comfortable.,4,,2025-02-20T21:05:59.000Z,"I have travelled frequently from Aviemore to Perth through the winter period.Generally speaking the buses have been comfortable, warm and more or less on time. The staff try hard to please in stressful conditions. Service would be better if an earlier bus in the morning and a later one in the evening was available."

The journey is always very comfortable and relaxing makes it much better than me taking my car I love travelling by bus , so I wouldn’t travel any other way ever 💯"
Citylink,Quick service on a Sunday!,5,,2025-02-20T16:09:32.000Z,We took a service 900 trip that stops in both Maxim Park and Baillieston last Sunday afternoon and we were perfectly on time and had a great trip. We love the 900 service and travel to Edinburgh from Glasgow about once a week.
Citylink,No wonder people avoid bus travel.,1,,2025-02-20T15:45:49.000Z,"At Aberdeen bus station there was a total lack of information. About the appropriate stance, the fact the bus hadn’t arrived 15 minutes after it was due to depart and Jo one to ask. The return journey was twice delayed (15 minutes then 30 minutes) to enable the driver to comply with the law which obviously was not his fault. Not was it his fault that the heating was jammed full on making conditions horrendous in spite of the fact he said he had reported it “time upon time” and ignored. The one star is gif the driver who was pleasant, helpful and blameless."
Citylink,902 was great.,3,,2025-02-26T19:37:23.000Z,"Update 26 Feb | I can confirm the 902 has a tracker and that it works. I stumbled on it and used it both ways last week. | It was transformative and I will now be using the 902 more often. |  | Well done city link. | 902 was great. | Lunchtime service Coatbridge to Glasgow deteriorated such that I don't use it anymore. Totally unreliable. I now use train to Glasgow and bus back. | The lack of a tracker is a serious failing, I've seen many times people waiting at bus stop for upward of 20 minutes before abandoning their bus trip. You just never know where it is and how long you'd wait. | Such a shame. Get a tracker please"
Citylink,Fantastic Serviceo …,5,,2025-02-20T15:20:57.000Z,"Use this service often to and from both Edinburgh and Glasgow airports and for breaks away to several Towns and Cities. | Great Service,always on time,comfy seats.drivers friendly ,polite,and helpful. | Highly Reccommend"
Citylink,I make my reservations for travel online,5,,2025-02-20T15:20:44.000Z,"I make my reservations for travel online. Simple and straight forward. The coaches are clean, comfortable and always on time"
Citylink,The buses are comfortable and usually…,3,,2025-02-20T15:19:16.000Z,"The buses are comfortable and usually on time. However, I travel regularly between Edinburgh and Aberdeen and use my time productively. So it is really frustrating that there is no WIFI available. Other bus companies provide WIFI so why not Citylink? It's essential for the business traveller."
Citylink,Dreadful app,2,,2025-02-20T15:09:26.000Z,In my experience when you are on the bus the journey is good: the buses are comfortable and the drivers are generally friendly. However the Citylink app is dreadful. I last used the service in November: I was returning from the rugby in Edinburgh and deliberately left it until late evening to catch the bus back to Glasgow. I waited over an hour that Sunday evening hoping to catch a limped of the distinctive Citylink bus. The app was useless: buses simply “disappeared (as too did part of the route from central Edinburgh!). The experience means I am now more likely to drive to and from Edinburgh rather than rely on Citylink. So disappointing as I would like to be able to rely on public buses
Citylink,Bad communication caused a lot of stress,1,,2025-02-20T15:01:11.000Z,"Had booked bus home from Glasgow. On arrival late into Ft William, the driver advised that the bus would leave at 1640 instead of the usual 1650. I went for a coffee and went back to find the bus wasn't at the stance at 1630. On checking the app, it stated that bus had departed at 16.28 and was now in Spean Bridge. Change of driver in Ft William and driver before obviously had not communicated with new driver. Bus left with my suitcase and medication still on board. I had to book into hotel as this was the last bus of the day. I have 2 main concerns about this. First of all, there should be a handover by previous driver, advising new driver how many passengers had booked straight through to Skye from Glasgow and a head count should be taken of those on board by the new driver. The bus should not depart without checking this. Secondly, in this day and age it is totally irresponsible of Citylink to depart with an unknown suitcase aboard. This would not be allowed at an airport, so why on a bus. It is a security risk. This journey caused a lot of stress and hassle for me. I have oesteoarthritis in both knees and need my medication to help me sleep. On calling Citylink, I was told driver had gone for petrol. Not so. The app showed that the bus was in Spean Bridge. Total lack of communication between 2 drivers caused enormous upset and stress for me and my family. Surely you could do better Citylink!"
Citylink,Good service,4,,2025-02-20T14:58:12.000Z,"I always use Citylink from Glasgow to Edinburgh Airport in the Tourist saison (April to November). Sometimes, they have not the right size of the bus to carry all people. Therefore you need to book in advance. | The drivers are always kind and helpful."

Citylink,My journey from Edinburgh to…,3,,2025-02-15T11:18:10.000Z,My journey from Edinburgh to Lochgilphead involved a change of bus in Glasgow. Both legs of the journey were on time and the drivers friendly and helpful. On the second part of the journey the driver warned you in advance of the next stop and time taken to reach it. This was very helpful especially to people not familiar with the area. In the many journeys I have taken on that route this is the first time this has happened. I think it should be made compulsory to make these announcements. | That is where the positives end. The website is AWFUL and is unusable on iPhone. It works on iPad but who carries that around in their pocket!? For a company of this size it is quite frankly unacceptable and needs fixing. | I averaged out on 3 stars but actually I would have give the physical journey 4 or 5(could do with USB charging sockets) but I would only give 1 star for website accessibility.
Citylink,Very helpful Driver …,4,,2025-02-15T00:34:03.000Z,Took the 900 at 09.15 from Buchanan Street to Edinburgh on Tuesday 11/2/25. Wasn’t really sure which stop to get off in Corstorphine Road -and could only give minimal info -but the lovely driver Tom went out of his way to make sure we got off at the right stop. | Really couldn’t have been more helpful and a credit to Citylink
Citylink,"Once again, takes your money but no tickets",1,,2025-02-12T20:10:20.000Z,"Once again, the app has taken payment for my booking, but not made a booking or provided the tickets. This time the reference is 17716113. | This seems to be an inherent fault with the Citylink app, which has existed for several months, so it's about time it was fixed."
Citylink,Electronic tickets should be accessible through Apple Wallet.,2,,2025-02-10T18:30:27.000Z,Having electronic tickets is useful and makes sense but only useful if they can be stored in the Apple Wallet. Otherwise inconvenient.
Citylink,My bus for which was scheduled for 1:30…,1,,2025-02-08T16:17:14.000Z,"My bus for which was scheduled for 1:30 in the afternoon got delayed by an hour and to add to this I was waiting in the cool for approximately one and half cause the bus was late. After an hour's wait the bus finally showed up but never stopped at the bus top and went past the bus stop and the driver sighed out with his hands and zoomed by, which is not right on my end I have paid for the ticket from a particular stop so attest as a curtesy they should stopped at the stop but this outright not responsible. My plans for the evening are in total loss and have lost my match due to this."
Citylink,Scottish Service at its Best Not !!,1,,2025-02-08T16:14:42.000Z,"Well where do I start |  | Bus from Dundee to Glssgow meant to leave at 12.20pm leaves at 12.33pm, packed because there is a problem with the Edinburgh bus being delayed as it has hit a pheasant....poor bird :( |  | The Edinburgh bound passengers are advised that they will chsnge at Broxden Perth to continue on another bus to the Capital. |  | We arrive in Perth and instead of going direct to Broxden, we have 2 'local' stops in Perth |  | At one of the stops the driver spends 5 minutes trying to wake up a girl, still in her baffies probably after a hard night on the lash, without success, so we are further delayed. We are about to leave and the nightgirl suddenly wakes up and gets off the bus ! |  | We then move on to Broxden and there is a changeover for the Edinburgh bound passengers so I assume only to hear the driver shout for Glasgow bound travellers to | change bus too. I gather my things together, get my small suitcase from the hold and then get on a packed double decker bus which Im told is a direct bus to Glasgow.....I thought that I had booked a direct bus to Glasgow with one stop off at Broxden Perth. |  | The service was chaotic and lacking in any organisation and you were treated like a herd of cattle and if you didnt like it, lump it ! |  | Train for me from now on Im afraid and will not be fulfilling my booked return trip tomorrow"

Citylink,Amazing service and amazing driver!,5,,2025-01-31T23:23:50.000Z,"When the bus arrived in Oban, the driver told us he was going to take an alternate route as there had been a crash on the route. This meant I was going to miss my connection to London. However, the driver phoned ahead and made sure I was booked onto the next bus. And in the end of turned out we were just going to make it, so the driver again proactively phoned ahead and made sure the bus I had originally been booked on would wait for me! Amazing service (and amazing driving), really going above and beyond!"
Citylink,Buses are very confusing for passengers…,1,,2025-01-17T15:44:24.000Z,"Buses are very confusing for passengers , the app for booking is also very confusing, when buses arrive I always have to ask the drivers if its the correct bus as they are all M9, M8 ect, and they all go different places. I know off people who have got on the wrong bus as the drivers dont check your booking ticket properly and just take you onboard, this has caused terrible distress for them."
Citylink,902 link OFTEN VERY LATE,1,,2025-01-16T09:40:16.000Z,"902 link OFTEN VERY LATE. Don’t recommend. Yesterday 15/01/25 the 18.30 bus from Buchanan bus station was extremely late (~40mins) and when it arrived it was announced that it won’t be going as the driver needed his 45min break (which is fair) and they couldn’t find another driver. |  | Today 16/01/25 the 7.24 bus from Chapelhall didn’t turn up. I along with others waited for the 7.54 bus but even that was 15 minutes late. This has happened numerous times since I used this service 2 months ago. |  | I understand that unexpected things happen but when it happens TOO OFTEN, surely you must have thought to develop strategies to cope with these issues, if you really care about your customers as you claim you do."

However, I was not disappointed, the Fort William to Glasgow arrived at at Glencoe on time (Friday 20 Sept - 1740 service).The bus itself was clean, comfortable and the driver very helpful and friendly. Taking in the surrounding view through the mountains was stunning and something you can't really do when you're driving, an unexpected bonus and definitely worth doing again.

I spent another 10 minutes in vain waiting to see if the driver would come back. | I did not see the point of waiting another hour incase the same thing happened. So, I paid for a bus to take me into the city centre. At 7pm the service bus for Livingston came and I had to pay again. | Instead of arriving in Livingston at 6.25 by the 902, I arrived at 8.05, an hour and a half later, all because the driver did not bother to stop. | I count myself lucky; an elderly couple waiting to go to Coatbridge were left stranded. They had a choice of chancing another hour or taking a bus into Haymarket train station and paying a train fare. | I cannot understand for the life of me why a bus driver would come into the airport and not stop to uplift passengers. Surely he must have had even a small bit of common sense to know passengers would be waiting! | The bus paid an entrance fee to pass through the security gate to enter the airport, for what?

Later on in the journey the said yob and his friends started smoking cannabis, making the top deck quite aromatic. Letting on someone like that is just asking for trouble. |  | Update: 19th September | I replied to CityLink as invited to in their reply. There response was a bit of a joke. They said ""In such circumstances we would strongly advise making the driver aware of any inappropriate behaviour, so as this can be addressed at the time or at the very least a record of such an incident can be made."". Obviously I let the driver know about the threat of violence when I got on, and they didn't address it at all. The only appropriate way to address that would be to not let the person on."
