Stagecoach UK,Who manages this awful bus company?! You are deliberately trying to annoy people!!,1,,2025-04-03T10:28:52.000Z,"Always late. Always in poor conditions both mechanically and also visually. The 8 service should go from Westwood Cross to Canterbury and then Canterbury back to Westwood Cross. The 8 from Westwood to Canterbury should stop at Pilgrims Hospice Margate at 06:55 am. It did not. Technically it did turn up (well the bus that should have been the 8 service) it flew past Pilgrims Hospice Margate at speed as though it were on a formula one track and the driver was Max Verstappen at 06:50 am and I believe it said it wasn’t in service which it should have been. I mean there was a few people on it. So I checked the online times (not that those make a difference, they are never accurate either, but it did say that the next 8 bus was arriving at Pilgrims Hospice at approximately 09:18 am and 09:20 am. I was not prepared to wait from nearly 07:00 am until 09:18, basically 2 and half hours (almost) I also wasn’t really prepared to also wait for a Loop Bus into Margate Cecil Square due to having to pay out more, and let’s face it. I’m not willing to pay more for a service that’s not even remotely anywhere near decent or pleasant. So I walked myself down to Marine Terrace, Margate. There was a number 8x service stopped at Margate Cecil Square as I was approaching the seafront, Marine Terrace. The 8x should have been heading to Canterbury. Instead it was only going as far as Birchington. So I could have got that bus if it was going to Canterbury like it was supposed to. So I walked just a little bit Further to Marine Terrace. I got there at around 08:20 am. The live timetables showed an 8x service that was actually gouging to Canterbury this time at 08:30 am. No 15 minutes late. Not only that, it was overfilled leaving most passengers including myself basically stuck in the doorway part of the bus with little to hold onto. Not safe at all. The bus an all round unpleasant experience as are most of experiences with Stagecoach especially in the South East. It was rattling very loudly, creaking, wobbling, bouncing erratically and generally making the most unpleasant noises. It was also very unclean, it was clear that the bus had not not been maintained or indeed cleaned at all. As I mention this, most or indeed all of the buses that are run by Stagecoach in the South East are usually unclean and in very poor conditions. At the end of this I was very late. Should be arriving at at my destination at around 08:30 and 08:45 as usual. Looking like 10:00 am today. I have always not been on time to my destination with Stagecoach. I have had many problems at my destination due to my timekeeping skills. So Stagecoach explain yourselves to Canterbury College."

Stagecoach UK,I would give less if I could!,1,,2025-03-28T09:58:32.000Z,"I would give less if I could! I pay for 2 monthly passes at £97 each for my two teenage children to use to get to school per month because our local authority, in their infinite wisdom, decided not to subsidise the student passes. The first bus they get in the morning from home sometimes never arrives and the next one is an hour later, meaning they would miss the only one of 3 school area buses they would get next. This has happened once a week for three weeks and they never warn anyone on their service update page or twitter. I have had to find emergency lifts so I don’t get prosecuted by the school for their absences. I have complained but sadly it seems it falls on deaf ears! It’s a pity as this is such a vital public service that is being neglected by the company itself. I fear that Stagecoach will kill the public bus service leaving thousands if not millions stranded and unable to go to work or school and abandoning the elderly. Stagecoach, you should be ashamed of yourselves!"

When we got to the hospital she then helped this little old man that couldn't walk very fast and had a walker, she also helped him off the bus and made sure he was okay. Never seen this before and think she should get some sort of recognition. By the way when she got back on the bus after taking the lady across the road people gave her a clap which was so deserved, she is a good ambassador for the company."

It made a child extreaming paranoid and leading to anger. A fight then occurred in a local store. I am extreamly disappointed stagecoach. Us trying to run to the bus' occurence ended in a incident of my friend dropping her ceaser wrap. We then boared the next bus and all of us were extreamly angry and sad.

Stagecoach UK,The s4 from Banbury to Oxford or visa…,1,,2025-03-02T16:51:44.000Z,The s4 from Banbury to Oxford or visa versa is absolutely terrible the seats are absolutely filthy with dirt and the buses must be at least 20 years old this journey takes about in average an hour and a half.The seat coverings are made of draylon if they were leather (like it was about 5 years ago s4 gold) you could easily clean the seat very uncomfortable and most of the windows won't open.Surely the length of this journey should have better quality buses absolutely disgrace especially since the government as been paying a considerable amount to Stagecoach over the passed 3 years or so.So if you are reading this head of Stagecoach sort it out. I also got to say the drivers are all sound and helpful on this route it is just the state of the buses we are in the 21st century Stagecoach upgrade the buses with the money the government av giving you instead of putting it in the head of Stagecoach banks

What are you doing to do Mr Manager of Stagecoach apart from bragging about the fantastic new electric bus?"
Stagecoach UK,Who manages this awful bus company??,2,,2025-02-17T14:17:52.000Z,Hopeless bus company - badly managed and unreliable service. Three times I’ve been left waiting for over an hour in the cold because the scheduled bus simply disappeared off the schedule. Time to complain to the local MP and suggest a different service provider since the review overall are pointing to a company that is not fit to run a public service. People rely on public transport for their livelihoods and the elderly cannot be left freezing in the cold not knowing when the next bus is coming. Please write to your local MP!

You were driving without due care and attention, you should not be stopping oncoming road users and aggressively stating false Highway Code and legal rights and to do so to a police class 1 driving assessor was very ill advised. | I hope your bosses heed this notice and ensure you are warned to refrain from making false statements to other drivers and request you conduct yourself more professionally."

When asked what happened I just get ""don't know, sorry"" . That's not something you wanna hear after 50min of standing in freezing weather at 5AM. I'm never late for work, but since last week I have been late for 1.5h for 3 days. I'm glad that I have understanding management,but how long until I end up being written up? Stagecoach has monopoly on my area so it's not like I can choose a different service,but atleast do something about the app when cancelling, if I know that it won't show up, update the thing so I can contact someone to grab me on the way.

Stagecoach UK,Pathetic,1,,2025-01-17T20:54:05.000Z,"Absolutely the worst bus company on this planet, stagecoach Sunderland owned by foreigners run by idiots, never run on time, always cancelling. The local council needs to take over and run it like it use to be with inspectors on the road not experienced drivers sitting in warm office.If it was possible to award ZERO stars then it would be ZERO stars. I have emailed several times and the response is negative."

Stagecoach UK,Sometimes completely unreliable,1,,2025-01-16T09:32:46.000Z,"Sometimes reliable but sometimes completely useless. The X4 is supposed to leave the main Northampton bus stop at 7:03 AM but I think it leaves at 7:18 instead as it arrives at a further bus stop at 7:22 AM, making people late for work. | What's the point of having a bus service in the mornings if you're unreliable and can't run on time? | Also, Stagecoach should be aware their employees are doing things like having lunch when they're supposed to leave, my partner uses the X6 from Northampton to Milton Keynes and it's been late (because the driver went into McDonalds) or cancelled so many times in a year I can't even count on two hands. The X6 is literally ALWAYS late. If it's not late, then it's cancelled. |  | If this is not the employee's fault and indeed they need more time for lunch / breaks then the company should absolutely reconsider those. Anyway, Stagecoach is sometimes (1/10 maybe) completely unreliable and this brings its rating down, shame other times it's running on time but as a big company you can't afford exceptions, you *have* to be reliable at all times."
Stagecoach UK,17.35 Sheffield to Stocksbridge is 25…,1,,2025-01-15T19:47:41.000Z,17.35 Sheffield to Stocksbridge is 25 minutes late. Meaning there has been no bus from Sheffield to Stocksbridge for 1hr 10 minutes in rush hour. Meanwhile 7 88s are out on the road making sure Basegreen and Burngreave road is well served. Ecclesfield Stagecoach and Matt Kitchen are a joke. Stagecoach please look into what Matt Kitchen has done to Stocksbridge and the surrounding areas. 28k people and 2 buses an hour. Good to see Richard Eyre of Sheffield City council showing his displeasure of the current service.

The glass barrier between driver and customer could be the issue and can’t hear what he said but please don’t shout customer like that. Literally was about to angry at his face but better just file a complaint. Always have the issue with card payments especially now the fare is increase so they have to ask where you going. Take ages to take to the bus because of buy the ticket on the bus. Why not just perhaps a feedback. Why not stage coach just take a tap system instead of speaking directly to driver so it may easier for customer and driver too. As I realised angry drivers actually not safety for both them and customers."

Given me a change voucher and then sold the correct ticket | 3. Given the correct ticket and then rectified HIS mistake later with his depot |  | Instead heres what he did: | 1. Argued with me for about three minutes about my ticket, despite several other passengers explicitly stating they heard me say nightrider.

Stagecoach UK,Blacon 14 and 14A Service Buses Too Small & Reduced Service,2,,2024-12-18T18:11:22.000Z,"Since the time table changed on 27th October reducing the bus services from every 10 minutes to every 15 minutes (on each service) the buses are constantly suffering from overcrowding (especially Stagecoach), add to this late buses and cancellations. |  | It should be noted that there was NO notification of these changes (other than a drunk man on the bus about a month before), the change just happened. |  | There are 2 providers, Arriva and Stagecoach. Stagecoach in Chester has 6 double deckers and the rest are single deckers ranging from less that 40 seat to around 44 max. With Arriva you get the same size capacity single decker. With Stagecoach you have no idea what bus you are going to get. They are now ALWAYS overcrowded in the morning going to work and coming home from work. |  | The buses are also old, with most between 10 and 15 years of age.

Stagecoach UK,A BUS SERVICE THAT DOES NOT LIKE TO LET PEOPLE ON,1,,2024-12-14T17:24:43.000Z,"Chronically lying about arrival times, cancelling buses without any notice whatsoever, thinking nobody is riding while some of us are freezing our balls off in another stop, are just a few of their many issues. Drivers also like to completely skip over stops when I’ve pressed the bell with plenty of time beforehand, and whenever they see anyone running towards a bus stop they just skip the stops altogether and hoof it. | Walking in what feels like -3 degrees Celsius while being stabbed in the eye by icy rain does feel agonizing, but after remembering how Stagecoach bends me over, it doesn’t seem so bad.

For the drivers to think it’s acceptable to make customers walk all the way to the stop where they should have been dropped off is completely unacceptable.

Meanwhile, we are left to walk in the cold to reach our final stops. |  | Thank you stagecoach bus Eastbourne for consistently making your bus services around the Hampden Park area as inconvenient as possible. |  | This is the fourth time your drivers have forced us to walk home in the cold simply because they CHOOSE to terminate the route where it is not supposed to end. |  | Another absolutely shit show of a bus service 😡"

I pressed the stop button whilst the bus was on Hope farm road before it turned into Overpool road where the next bus stop is situated . The driver did not stop until he got to Whitby high and when l confronted the driver he was unapologetic and said l did not press the button whilst after pressing the button the screen indicated and showed ‘ bus stopping ‘ . Very disappointed with the service and the least the driver could have done was to apologize . I feel like he did it on purpose

I'm consistently late for work despite trying to get a bus over an hour before my shift starts for a less than 25 minute journey.

I came across the same unpleasant man again (they had quite clearly done nothing about him), this time I was with my 70 year old mother, again there was bullying behaviour from him towards me and her, I made another complaint about him and the man I spoke to on the phone was helpful but again no one got back to me. This was over a year ago.I have no idea what they did (if anything) about the situation. This was the Andover branch, obviously quite a toxic environment, Im pretty sure the fact I am female had been a factor in them not doing anything about it. I still have to get on stage coach now and they are often breaking down (again coming from Andover), I recently got on one and it broke down a mile away from where I was catching my connection bus, so I had to walk in. Missing my bus and getting to work an hour late because my later bus was late too.I understand that its not the bus drivers fault that the buses are not well maintained and they can't help traffic but its really not good enough If you can avoid using a stage coach I would."

Stagecoach UK,X5 - poor and unreliable service,1,,2024-11-04T15:29:19.000Z,"Been using this service for nearly two years between Buckingham and Bedford. Not only are there clearly not enough buses running to fit the demand of passengers, but every single bus is constantly and continuously late. This would be acceptable if it was a mere 5/10 minutes, but regularly it is 30-40 minutes of time wasted. Considering that buses run once an hour very often during the day, the bus is regularly full, with nearly all of the plug sockets not working and non functioning heating in the winter time. |  | It’s a massive shame that this is the only company that runs buses between this location. Trains run to Milton Keynes station until almost 1am but the last bus is 8:45pm from Milton Keynes. The buses run the opposite direction until after midnight, so I see no reason as to why Stagecoach have decided people should only be able to get to the station/ coach station and not back from it.

But there are so many drivers which I have seen go above and beyond many times which is why I have given 3 stars.

Personally I think buses should be free for anyone under 18. As someone writing this review as someone who is in secondary school, I can passionately say that the bus gives me anxiety and if I travelled by myself I would be scared to get on. Sometimes the bus drivers aren’t even nice and don’t let everyone get in the bus. Today I waited for over 2 hours for my bus when it should have been 40 minutes.

Stagecoach UK,So many Newcastle stagecoach bus…,1,,2024-09-30T16:02:43.000Z,"So many Newcastle stagecoach bus drivers are extremely rude. Sorry but they are. They NEVER wait for you even when you’re 1 meter from the stop waving like hell. This is regularly the case when they are early and shouldn’t even be there yet! They just make eye contact and smugly drive off like it’s the biggest kick out of their day. I’ve even knocked on the door of the bus and had them still drive off. | I’ve also gotten off a bus and had the door close on me while leaving and the driver didn’t even apologise just looked embarrassed and shrugged. | The bell is a mild suggestion and you have to run down the stairs while it’s still moving and stand by the driver’s cabin for them to stop. They also let you out while stopped in traffic so they don’t have to pull up to the bus stop BUT if they’ve missed your stop or there’s a route change and you need to get off, they absolutely won’t let you off the bus and will happily kick customers out miles from their destination. | They are also nearly never on time or even show up at all. You also get 2 or 3 of the same number bus show up at once so if you miss it, it’s then another 20-30-40 minutes till the next bus/buses show up rather than 10 minutes (Who know when, the time tables are certainly not something to go off of). | Which is partly why it so upsetting when they don’t stop for you. | I used the bus a lot before and question if it’s actually as bad as I remember, then try using the bus again and I’m unpleasantly reminded how BAD it is."

How can a person make plans at all for their day when this keeps happening? |  | If my shifts weren't flexible, the number of times this happened over a few months, I could've lost my job. Many people are probably not as lucky. The lack of concern is unbelievable. |  | The board at the bus stop indicated the bus would arrive in 50 minutes. Had I not seen on the app hat it was cancelled, I would've waited. Sometimes they just turn up, in complete misalignment with the board and the app, which are often in misalignment with each other. They surprise you. |  | In Stracathro, the 40/40A is at least 10 minutes late. That is a given. The average is 20 minutes, with 30 or 40 minutes not uncommon. |  | Nothing against drivers or anyone in particular. Most are very nice.
