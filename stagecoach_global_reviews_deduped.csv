Stagecoach Global,In Exeter Stagecoach is VERY unreliable,1,,2025-02-27T11:03:46.000Z,"In Exeter, Stagecoach buses are very unreliable. A year ago I wrote and spoke to a responsible person at Devon council about buses 'disappearing' from the app when they're late. They said they knew of the issue and was trying to fix it. Today my bus was so late it dropped off the app and others were 30-45 mins late! Now I'm late for work. Get it together!!"

Stagecoach Global,Poor customer service,2,,2025-02-11T23:45:03.000Z,"Poor customer service. I wrote to Stagecoach to raise my frustration about the lack of clarity over their short journey fares, which should be £1.80. The response I received was simply to send me a screenshot of the £2.60 fare for a 3-stop journey on a 10K route (between Canterbury and Whitstable). When I responded asking for clarity re. what constitutes a short journey, I was ignored. After several days, I asked again and was still ignored. I then phoned and when I asked again what constitutes a short journey, I was told that they couldn’t tell me. I would just have to keep putting in different stops on the journey planner to find out. This is ridiculous. Stagecoach is clearly a company that does not have its customers at heart and will do their level best to charge as much as they possibly can. Their lack of responses on TP to any of the mostly poor reviews is a good indication of how little they care. Appalling."
Stagecoach Global,Fed up with Cheltenham to Gloucester 94…,1,,2025-02-10T09:41:26.000Z,Fed up with Cheltenham to Gloucester 94 Sunday service. They have a 94 service which goes via several villages and a X94 which goes via the A40 avoiding the villages. Either they prefer to concentrate on the shorter route or the drivers are getting confused and going via the short route leaving elderly people or people with young children waiting over 30 minutes for the next bus. Have asked them a couple of times to investigate but they don't seem bothered as I never hear anything. Only way to complain now a days is directed to the CEO?

On the return journey, same day, the 16.33 x18 bus there was a 20-mins delay. There is a systemic issue that Stagecoach do not want to fix. You can't keep hiding the problem behind the ""external factors"". Taxi company era earning a lot of money..."
Stagecoach Global,Openly holding rural customers in contempt,1,,2025-01-26T20:21:00.000Z,"Despite the COVID fund and an increased stipend from the Scottish Government Stagecoach has steadfastly refused to reinstate most the rural services they cancelled during the lockdown. | Instead they have increased urban routes to push up the mileage rates, using that as a mechanism to reduce their rural service. | In our village it really is ridiculous, you can get one bus into town at 10:38 and you have to return at 12:18, otherwise you are stranded. There are simply no other buses and, should wish to go any further than the local town, it would need to be an overnight trip. | Stagecoach's contempt for rural customers is absolutely jaw-dropping, they seem to treat us as little more than an annoying inconvenience and have no interest in improving the service they offer us, they are seemingly content to leave us as second-class citizens for whom travel is an undeserved luxury."

Stagecoach Global,FRAUD,1,,2025-01-21T09:27:39.000Z,"Stagecoach is attempting to coerce people into buying tickets when they already have them.

Took 2 hours to travel 7 miles using 2 different Stagecoach buses yesterday evening. One bus was 40 minutes late, the other one left 15 minutes late.

As card is so requested for payment nowadays it’s the only means of payment I had on me. I then said I will book it online and proceeded to do it in front of the driver, he then mocked me because for thinking he said port instead of court, I am hard of hearing but also it is just genuinely loud on a bus. This happened on my short journey from ore to Hastings town. This bus was the 322C didn’t catch the drivers name although it was at around 10:20 this morning. Very disappointed."

Not every one has access to a computer or Internet, especially the elderly (an 80 plus gentleman was told this morning that he should have googled it before travelling. The driver was not having it that he didn't own a computer or a mobile phone). |  | At the end of my journey I asked the driver why there were no signs up at bus stops or on the bus. He said that they were in the office gathering dust and were not given out to anyone.

Stagecoach Global,Worst bus service ever!,1,,2024-12-23T14:57:26.000Z,"Awful bus service, been having issues with buses for 3 years now with this particular service, the thanet service is god awful, the buses are late constantly some never even show up, constantly being made late for things, their service is well below par, I've been complaint to stagecoach for a long time now and made numerous complaints, nothing ever changes with this service if does it don't last long and right back to dysfunctional service, for someone to have to rely on such a dysfunctional service is not acceptable by any means, this company has never compensated me ever for the years of frustration, effecting my mental health, making me late all the time, losing my place on dentist lists and all sorts I'm sick fed up with having to rely on such a rubbish bus service, over 3 years the have had crap excuses for it and still continues today, I'm actually thinking of taking court action again this bus firm, to think of all the hours days weeks that add up to usbstanding around waiting for terrible service to show up, I for one am fed up of stagecoach being so unreliable to people who rely on public transport. At time some buses don't even stop but are running had so many issue and enough is enough and I'm done with the excuses of stagecoach either no fix or compensation for customer who get greatly effected by it. If I had another choice of bus I would use it and never use stagecoach again that how fed up I am of this company and it do nothing approach its clear stagecoach don't value their customers, as a vulnerable adult who relys on public transport its not acceptable to be having such issues, I'm to go back to work at the hospital and I know this service is going to cause me a lot of troubles, not looking forward to it, also buses stop running at ridiculous times in margate so if working incant get back on the bus and have to use trains which I don't want to be. Buses should still be running till normal times at night. I'm a very disgruntled customer very unhappy with how things are currently and have been for such a long time. Today again and the other day buses late then don't show at all. I for one am sick of all the standing around and time wasting i do throughout my life due to bus services being way below par for services, we rely on you do it needs to be addressed and sorted out final, even the buses constantly being stopped by crossings which had had huge influx every time you get there its down be it car or bus it adds to things already going bad, stagecoach always have the road works excuse and sorry but that don't take 3 years to get though it, the amount of not in service buses that pass when your waiting for a bus and is already late and they come at the time onenis meant to come but is out of service, common thing that, stagecoach really got to sort it out and quickly."

I stood there in the freezing cold as the time for the bus arrival got later and later. It eventually turned up over an hour late than scheduled. Said to the driver you are over an hour late, his response was "" I don't care how late I am"". Your drivers are rude and impatient when dealing with customers.

Stagecoach Global,Writing from West Sussex,1,,2024-11-30T22:29:30.000Z,"Writing from West Sussex. Local Stagecoach service is dire, as bad as it gets. Buses cancelled at last moment, disappearing from departures boards, after counting down from 4 minutes away. Buses leaving early from stops, leaving passengers stranded. Buses which are supposed to arrive at 15 minute intervals arriving 2 minutes apart. Drivers in training and family and friends of drivers distracting drivers for long periods by talking to drivers, as they drive, and even leaning into the driver cab to do so, despite signs in bus warning passengers not to do that. Drivers leaving dirty diesel engines running, while they get off the bus to have a smoke etc. That’s against the Highway Code, and pollutes the air, but these morons can’t work that out. Don’t bother complaining to Stagecoach HQ re any of this. I tried that! I was given a case number and told I would get a response within 5 working days. Months later, still waiting for any response. Stagecoach, your service is crap."

Nothing on the app and no explanation or apology from the driver. |  | I have had other issues with stagecoach before such as the driver speeding and nearly knocking cyclists over multiple times. I have to use the service for work and it is very frustrating being left in the freezing cold not knowing if a bus is coming because it disappears from the map even though it says it is still going to arrive! I have always used the busses but recently I haven’t had many good experiences. Leaving people vulnerable and not happy with the service."

Almost. The app is broken (even after it's been updated & the cache cleared - new Android flagship), the information on Google is incorrect & confusing. Most (not all) drivers are beyond the pale (some still have souls); the one that was nice to me didn't know the best way because buses just don't go to some places sometimes (buses every hour... except, for some reason, 3pm 😂🙄). Some evening services from places like Kingswear (arguably the place most in need of service) have been removed meaning I'm trapped in my town without a taxi or car. 2 days without a car visiting from London & the difference is insane 😂 Add in the lack of bus route updates, drivers leaving early & ignoring you running towards the stop as you wonder why they're like this, the litany of ridiculously poorly planned road works it's almost unlivable around here lol"

Stagecoach Global,Waste of time!!!,1,,2024-09-19T17:16:46.000Z,Waste of time!!!! 8.13am bus always at least 30 mins late !!
Stagecoach Global,Buses disappearing off the map?,1,,2024-09-19T11:14:17.000Z,"Constantly late every day but today it was 30 minutes late and decides to completely disappear and make me wait for the next one. This constantly makes me miss lessons and gets me in trouble, hundreds of pounds wasted on this."
Stagecoach Global,Bad timing,1,,2024-09-17T23:13:51.000Z,"I always use the MK1 to luton and I've never been more disappointed in my life, the bus timing is horrible I waited an hour in the cold because the bus was late, I went to school late once, it's so frustrating"
Stagecoach Global,Great stuff…,5,,2024-09-15T12:30:02.000Z,"Massive thank to driver of bus 65 from calver 0751 ,he took time out to find out the bus number and stand I would need for onward trip to catcliffe boundry mill,Massive help 1st time I've been thank you,"
Stagecoach Global,absolutely fuming!,1,,2024-09-14T23:01:08.000Z,"absolutely fuming! number 6 bus came 40 minutes late and when it did decide to show up a group of girls asked the NUMBER SIX bus to go to HEADLAND. the number six doesn’t go to headland and that is the opposite way it’s supposed to go, despite all that he still went to headland anyways when i was meant to be going to burn valley. i had no more money, and no more data so i was stranded for HOURS. didnt know bus drivers were just allowed to change routes??? not to mention im under the age of 16 and it was late outside. had to wait in the freezing weather for ages!!"
Stagecoach Global,Stagecoach Angus area,1,,2024-09-14T11:21:38.000Z,"Living in Forfar , but often need to travel to Montrose, only 18 miles away. But its the only town that doesnt have a direct bus from forfar, and now since some clueless clown in office tampered with the timetables, 1 hr 30 mins is the shortest time to get there and changing bus in brechin or arbroath, with at least 30 - 45 mins wait. Gonna enjoy that in the winter.especially older people. Why cant they have a circular route going through the 4 main angus towns Arbroath - Forfar - Brechin - Montrose ? Who ever makes these plans has never needed to take a bus in their lives ."
Stagecoach Global,Drive for Stagecoach in Bedford not worth It.,1,,2024-09-10T17:16:47.000Z,"I will say some people will love It if you can laugh with the trainer and fellow bus drivers just to get on within the company, are happy to just nod and agree with what's being asked and said, enjoy very unsociable hours with even the training starting at 7AM yes you did read that right. The money is good if you don't actually start to think about your work/life balance, not fit for service buses that really you have no buisness in taking out, you've heard off the gossiping in an office environment It's no better with bus drivers. The Bedford depot really needs knocking down, my advice if you drive then join another company that offers the extra hourly rate and added perks. Even the holidays are more on the company's timetable then the dates that you want, with no sickpay even being paid for the first 3 days. In closing think of an expensive restaurant well this place is the same nothing is for free, join the union not cheap, sick pay cover ( after the first 3 days) not cheap, cover for death in service not cheap, company pension not cheap, added together and you will need to do the overtime which equals an even worse work/life balance."

Stagecoach Global,stagecoach 192 drivers.,1,,2024-09-05T11:36:04.000Z,the bills driver parks up at the bus stop. does not even wait. not even 30 seconds. and just drives off. this isn't just my recent experiance. this has been happening for years. if you ask me I hate your service. the busses don't turn up 1 at a time. 3 turn up together. 1 will be packed and the other 2 busses will drive off. iv been using this bus service since 2000 a very long time.

Stagecoach Global,You can't get on a worst bus than this,1,,2024-09-03T17:55:49.000Z,I usually travel in the 3 bus route from frimley. Never bother to stop at stops. Disrespectful drivers. Will look to start an argument even if you are not. the driver not stopped at stops.they are ignorant.
Stagecoach Global,Cambridge,1,,2024-09-02T18:29:57.000Z,Cambridge - stage coach buses are never on time. Never! It is always delayed and fails to keep up with the schedule. Every single time. I have been working in Cambridge for past 6 weeks - and not even once the evening bus (No.6 ) came on time to our bus stop at Girton. Always making me miss my connecting train to London.
Stagecoach Global,Unacceptable hot  buses!,1,,2024-09-01T18:02:25.000Z,Great regular service but using unacceptable buses with no working aircon or opening windows! causing you to get off the bus a sweaty mess as bus conditions are airless & very hot!

Stagecoach Global,Unprofessional,1,,2024-08-28T14:46:21.000Z,"Gosh, where to start! Actual bus service great - female driver not so much. Aggressive attitude who said OUT LOUD ""I don't like dealing with customers"", and I don’t get paid enough for this"". Lord almighty - they pay you?! Er, you may want to change your job then. Such was her butch and confrontational attitude that even Mike Tyson would think twice about slinging her a right hook. In summary, unprofessional, hates her job but hates people more. What a candidate hey!"
Stagecoach Global,Disgraceful service now from Huntingdon…,1,,2024-08-26T09:24:29.000Z,Disgraceful service now from Huntingdon to Cambridge. Buses take forever to even get to the busway because of a ridiculous route up to Wyton on the Hill and around the St Ives housing estate. Not practical for people who need to commute to work and who will have no choice but to drive to avoid a 1.5 hour trip
